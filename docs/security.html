    <h2 align="center">Security on the <em>WN</em> Server</h2>
    <hr size="4">

    <p>
      A great deal of effort has gone into attempting to make <em>WN</em> as
      secure as possible.  Security has received the highest priority in all
      design decisions.  This is not grounds for <em>WN</em> maintainers to
      feel they can lessen their vigilance, however.  The first thing you
      should be aware of is that there is a trade-off between security and
      functionality.  You can have high security and restricted functionality
      or lower security with greater functionality, or something in between.
      <em>WN</em> is designed to let the maintainer choose the point on this
      continuum he or she is comfortable with.  This document tries to discuss
      the various options you as a maintainer will have and what the
      implications of your choices are.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, it is important to understand possible threats to the integrity of
      a system running the <em>WN</em> server.  There are two types of threat
      which this document addresses separately: (1) external, from a client or
      purported client on a remote host, and (2) local, from a user with an
      account on the server host.
    </p>

    <p>
      After reading this section you may wish to look at the section "<a
      href="index_desc.html#file_owner">File Ownership and Permissions</a>" in
      this guide.
    </p>



    <h3>4.1 <a name="threats_external">External Threats</a></h3>

    <p>
      The maintainer's objective is to prevent any unauthorized access to (or
      alteration of) files on the host system.  Programs run on the server with
      the <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> protocols
      cause special problems and are discussed separately below.  If you do not
      need to use any executable programs you should run the server with the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#e_opt"><code>-e</code></a> option.  This option
      disallows any attempt to execute a command on your server and does not
      allow any data sent by a client even to be written to a temporary disk
      file.  In this situation the key to <em>WN</em> security is twofold: no
      document is served without explicit permission from the maintainer; and
      nothing is written to disk on the server except the log file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The basic philosophy of <em>WN</em> security is that by default no client
      requests are granted.  Permission to serve a document must be explicitly
      granted by the maintainer.  The <em>WN</em> server keeps a small database
      in each directory of its data hierarchy which contains information about
      files to be served from that directory.  In particular no document can be
      served unless explicit permission to serve it is given in such a
      database.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Note:</em> For more information on these database files the chapter
      "<a href="overview.html">An Overview of the <em>WN</em> Server</a>" in
      this guide is a good place to start.  These files are very easy to create
      and maintain.  See the chapter "<a href="index_desc.html">Creating Your
      <em>WN</em> Data Directory</a>" in this guide.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite this strong security foundation several additional steps are
      prudent.  The most important is that the maintainer must assure that no
      untrusted person has write access to any part of the <em>WN</em>
      hierarchy.  For example an incoming anonymous ftp directory should
      <strong>never</strong> be part of a <em>WN</em> hierarchy (better yet
      don't have one at all), because an attacker might be able to put a
      database there granting illicit access to some documents on the server
      system for which the user id running the server has read permission.
      There are several defenses against such a counterfeit database and we
      discuss them next.
    </p>


    <h4>4.1.1 <a name="threats_external.protect_index">Protecting Your
    <code>index.cache</code> Files</a></h4>

    <p>
      All security control for the <em>WN</em> server resides in the per
      directory database files (these files have the default name
      <code>index.cache</code>).  Consequently it is extremely important to
      guarantee their integrity.  There are several command line options for
      the server which help protect against counterfeit
      <code>index.cache</code> files.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a> or <a
      href="appendixA1.html#T_opt"><code>-T</code></a> option to
      <code>wnd</code> and <code>wnsd</code> allow you to specify a trusted
      owner or group owner (not both) for <code>index.cache</code> files.  When
      invoked with only the <a href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a>
      argument (or the <a href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-T</code></a>
      argument) <code>wnd</code> or <code>wnsd</code> will not serve a document
      unless the <code>index.cache</code> file listing it has the prescribed
      uid or gid.  This uid or gid should be that of the maintainer
      <strong>not</strong> the user id under which <code>wnd</code> or
      <code>wnsd</code> runs.  Indeed, for security reasons if the server has
      been started as <code>root</code> and changed to another uid it will
      refuse to use an <code>index.cache</code> file whose owner is the uid
      under which it is running.  If on your server all
      <code>index.cache</code> files are created by a single user or a single
      group I strongly recommend using the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a> or <a
      href="appendixA1.html#T_opt"><code>-T</code></a> option.
    </p>

    <p>
      This added security is weakened somewhat if you use the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#u_opt"><code>-u</code></a> option which allows
      <code>index.cache</code> files owned by untrusted users, but only permits
      them to grant access to files owned by the same user as the
      <code>index.cache</code> file.  This option might be appropriate if you
      permit users to have their own home page on your server.  It would allow
      users to serve documents which they own but no others.  If both the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#u_opt"><code>-u</code></a> and the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a> argument are used the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#u_opt"><code>-u</code></a> takes effect except the
      trusted user specified with the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a> option is exempt from
      its restrictions.  <em>Notice that if neither the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a> or <a
      href="appendixA1.html#u_opt"><code>-u</code></a> argument is used then a
      user with his own home page can make a symbolic link to any file readable
      by the server and that document will be served!  This is true even if the
      linked to document is in a directory with <a href="access.html">limited
      access</a> or is outside the server data hierarchy.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      When the server is run it must assume the permissions of some user on the
      host.  Which user is determined when you run the <a
      href="setup.html#installing.configure"><code>configure</code></a> program
      or by defining "<code><a
      href="configmacros.html#USERID">#define&nbsp;USER_ID</a></code>" in <a
      href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a>.  It is important that
      <code>USER_ID</code> have as few permissions as possible. On many systems
      there is a user called <code>nobody</code> with minimal permissions.  The
      numeric user_id of <code>nobody</code> is a good choice and is the
      default choice of the <em>WN</em> configure program. Of course the server
      must have read permission on all the files served but it should not have
      write permission for any directory or file other than its log files.  If
      the UNIX <a href="setup.html#logging"><code>syslogd(8)</code></a> system
      utility for logging is enabled there is not even any need for write
      permission on a log file.  A good practice is to have all the files in
      your hierarchy which you intend to serve be owned by the maintainer or
      their creator.  They should be world readable (assuming they are for
      general consumption) but with restricted write permission.  The files in
      your hierarchy should <em>not</em> be owned by the user id under which
      <em>WN</em> will run.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>WN</em> does not by default use the UNIX <code><a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man8/chroot.8.gz">chroot(8)</a></code>
      system utility to further restrict the files which the server can access.
      Doing so would enhance security at the expense of extra work for the
      maintainer.  The effect of this is to prevent the server from even
      internally accessing any file which is not in your data directory.  If
      you are especially concerned about security you may wish to run one of
      the public domain TCP wrappers, such as <a
      href="mailto:wietse@wzv.win.tue.nl">Wietse Venema</a>'s <a
      href="ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/security/tcp_wrappers_7.6.BLURB"><code>tcp_wrappers</code></a>
      (source code available at <a
      href="ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/security/tcp_wrappers_7.6.tar.gz"><code>ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/security/tcp_wrappers_7.6.tar.gz</code></a>),
      in conjunction with <em>WN</em> which will allow you to use the UNIX
      <code>chroot(8)</code> system utility.  This can simultaneously enhance
      security for other TCP services like the UNIX <code><a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man8/ftpd.8.gz">ftpd(8)</a></code>
      system utility.
    </p>


    <h4>4.1.2 <a name="threats_external.cgi">CGI Programs</a></h4>

    <p>
      Enabling the use of programs run on the server greatly enhances its
      functionality but also increases the potential risk of an attack.  Many
      things which on other servers can only be done with <a
      href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> programs are built-in
      features of <em>WN</em> and hence entail much less risk than they would
      as <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> programs.
      These include <a href="click.html">imagemaps</a>, a variety of <a
      href="search.html">document searches</a>, and serving <a
      href="parse.html#if">conditional text</a> based on information in the
      client supplied headers.  If your needs can be met with these features
      then you can disable <a
      href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> with the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#e_opt"><code>-e</code></a> option and greatly
      improve your security.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, there are many needs which can only be met by programs.  The
      greatest danger in their use is that even though the program is under the
      control of the maintainer, the arguments passed to it can be set by a
      potential attacker.  <em>WN</em> supports the <a
      href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> or "Common Gateway
      Interface" protocol (see the chapter "<a href="cgi.html">Using CGI
      Programs on the <em>WN</em> Server</a>" in this guide) for executing
      programs.  Under this protocol there are three ways by which arguments
      are passed to programs.  The first of these is used when processing <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/MarkUp/">HTML</a> forms which use the
      <code>GET</code> method.  Under this method all arguments are put in
      environment variables and the program must extract them from the
      environment.  Moreover, they have been placed in a <a
      href="http://linux-howto.com/rfc/rfc1500-1999/rfc1738.txt">URL</a>
      encoded format by the browser and must be decoded by the program.  Thus
      if the request is of type <code>GET</code>, the arguments are examined to
      see if they contain an '<code>=</code>'.  If they do, it is assumed that
      this is a <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> form
      response (something like
      "<code>name=John&amp;toppings=pepperoni</code>").  In this case the
      program is executed with no arguments and the argument string is placed
      in an environment variable where the program can read it.  This is fairly
      safe from the server point of view but the program writer must exercise
      great care.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second method is for <a href="http://www.w3c.org/MarkUp/">HTML</a>
      forms using the <code>POST</code> method.  In this case everything posted
      by the client (in <a
      href="http://linux-howto.com/rfc/rfc1500-1999/rfc1738.txt">URL</a>-encoded
      form) must be sent to the UNIX <code><a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man3/stdio.3.gz">stdin(3)</a></code>
      stream of the <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a>
      program.  Thus if the request is of type <code>POST</code>, information
      is read from the client and put in a temporary file on disk.  Then the
      program is executed with no arguments and its <code>stdin(3)</code> comes
      from this file.  Security is the responsibility of the program writer. It
      is not so dangerous to have arguments come from <code>stdin(3)</code> but
      the program writer must still exercise care.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally if the <code>GET</code> request has arguments but no
      '<code>=</code>' it is assumed to be an <code>ISINDEX</code> type request
      and the program should be executed with the given arguments.  While the
      <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> specification does
      not permit the altering of arguments, it does say that if the arguments
      pose any security problems it is permissible to put the string in an
      environment variable and execute the program with no arguments, just as
      in the <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> forms case
      described above.  <em>WN</em> takes a very strict view on this subject
      and considers any characters other than space and alphanumeric characters
      as a security problem.  Accordingly, if it finds any other character in
      an argument it will put all arguments in the appropriate environmental
      variable and run the program with no command line arguments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Again let me say <strong>the program writer must exercise great
      care</strong>. I can't emphasize this too strongly.  When you run a <a
      href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> program the server
      almost completely absolves itself of security responsibility and dumps
      that responsibility on the program writer.  Most authors of freely
      distributed <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a>
      programs are not fully cognizant of potential security holes they may
      open up.  Running insecure programs created locally or obtained from
      Usenet postings is almost certainly the single greatest risk to a
      <em>WN</em> server site.  To find out more about writing secure <a
      href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> programs I strongly
      recommend that you read the relevant sections of the "<a
      href="http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/WWW/faqs/www-security-faq.html#CGI">WWW
      Security FAQ</a>" maintained by <a href="mailto:lstein@cshl.org">Lincoln
      Stein</a> and the "<a
      href="http://www.go2net.com/people/paulp/cgi-security/safe-cgi.txt">Safe
      CGI Programming</a>" maintained by <a href="mailto:paulp@go2net.com">Paul
      Phillips</a>.
    </p>


    <h3>4.2 <a name="threats_internal">Internal Threats</a></h3>

    <p>
      Whenever untrusted users have accounts on a system there is risk
      involved.  The objective of <em>WN</em> is to insure that running the
      server does not increase this risk.  If the server is wisely managed, I
      believe this goal can be achieved.  Here are some guidelines.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it is possible make sure that no untrusted user has write access to
      any part of your <em>WN</em> hierarchy.  As mentioned above an attacker
      with write access to your hierarchy can create an
      <code>index.cache</code> file which will give access to anything on your
      server which is readable by the user id under which <em>WN</em> runs.
      Even worse, she can create a shell program and a <code>index.cache</code>
      file permitting it to be executed, so it can be executed with all the
      permissions of that user id.  A good rule of thumb is:
    </p>


    <blockquote>
      <em>Note:</em> Always assume that everyone with write access to any part
      of your data hierarchy has all the permissions of the user id under which
      your server runs!
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This should not be true if you are using some of the command line options
      described above, but it is good practice to behave as if it were true.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes it is not possible or desirable to deny write access to your
      <em>WN</em> hierarchy.  For example, you may need to allow all users to
      have a home page in their home directory or in some other designated
      place.  There are two important things to do in this case.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first of these is run the server with the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#u_opt"><code>-u</code></a> option.  This has the
      effect of requiring that every file served (including <a
      href="parse.html#wrapping">wrappers</a> and <a
      href="parse.html#including">includes</a>) have the same owner as the
      <code>index.cache</code> file which grants it permission to be served.
      This means that untrusted users can only serve files which they own.
      This will prevent a user from serving the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man5/passwd.5.gz"><code>passwd(5)</code></a>
      configuration file typically in <code>/etc</code>, but will not prevent
      him from making his own copy of <code>passwd(5)</code> and serving that.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the <a href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a> or <a
      href="appendixA1.html#T_opt"><code>-T</code></a> option is also used then
      <code>index.cache</code> files owned by the trusted user or trusted group
      are exempt from this requirement and they may grant permission to serve
      any file the server can read.  For security reasons the server will
      refuse to use an <code>index.cache</code> file which is a symbolic link
      to another file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="appendixA1.html#e_opt"><code>-e</code></a> or <a
      href="appendixA1.html#E_opt"><code>-E</code></a> option <a
      href="#threats_external.cgi">mentioned above</a> are also a good idea in
      this case, to prevent any execution of programs or at least restrict
      their execution to trusted <code>index.cache</code> files.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should note that when run in its default configuration there is no
      way to use <a href="access.html#ip">access files</a> or <a
      href="access.html#authenticate">password authentication</a> to prevent
      users on your system, who can create <code>index.cache</code> files, from
      gaining access to files you are serving.  They can simply make a symbolic
      link in their part of the hierarchy to the file you want to restrict and
      a <code>index.cache</code> file permitting it to be served.  Since the
      server has access to the restricted file it will serve it if it is listed
      in a <code>index.cache</code> file. This simple threat can be avoided by
      using the <a href="appendixA1.html#u_opt"><code>-u</code></a> option
      described above, but the number of potential threats is quite large.  For
      example, if the <a href="appendixA1.html#e_opt"><code>-e</code></a> or <a
      href="appendixA1.html#E_opt"><code>-E</code></a> option is not used a
      hostile user could write a <a
      href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> program which reads
      the sensitive files and mails them to himself.  In general I would
      strongly advise against trying to have sensitive documents (protected by
      password or <a href="access.html#ip"><code>.access</code></a> files) and
      potentially hostile users on the same server.  I would also strongly
      advise against allowing potentially hostile <a
      href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> programs, executed
      includes or external modules.  They can be disallowed through the use of
      the <a href="appendixA1.html#e_opt"><code>-e</code></a> or <a
      href="appendixA1.html#E_opt"><code>-E</code></a> options.  If they are
      not disallowed a <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a>
      program can alter or destroy log files.  A hostile authorization module
      could collect user passwords.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="appendixA1.html#u_opt"><code>-u</code></a> and <a
      href="appendixA1.html#E_opt"><code>-E</code></a> options greatly enhance
      security, but it is important to keep the following principle in mind.
      <em>You should assume that any permissions you grant to the user id under
      which <em>WN</em> runs are also granted to every user who can create an
      <code>index.cache</code> file in your data hierarchy.</em>
    </p>



    <h3>4.3 <a name="authenticate">Password Authentication and Restriction by
    IP Address</a></h3>

    <p>
      <em>WN</em> offers two methods of limiting access to your hierarchy or
      parts of it.  See the chapter "<a href="access.html">Limiting Access to
      Your <em>WN</em> Hierarchy</a>" in this guide for information on how to
      use these features.
    </p>

    <p>
      These are useful for many purposes but I would not advise using them to
      protect extremely sensitive information.  The first of these methods is
      restriction by hostname or IP address.  It is not impossible to spoof a
      server with a fake IP address, but I think it is fairly difficult.  It is
      easier to use a counterfeit hostname.  For this reason I would suggest
      using IP addresses rather than host names in <a
      href="access.html#ip">access control files</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other method of limiting access is by password with the <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/Protocols/">HTTP/1.1</a> Basic Authentication
      scheme.  This is about as secure as using passwords with the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man8/ftpd.8.gz"><code>ftpd(8)</code></a>
      system utility to protect information.  This scheme is flawed in that it
      involves the transmission of essentially unencoded passwords over the
      network.  It is relatively easy for unscrupulous people to obtain
      "sniffer" software which allows eavesdropping on all local network
      traffic.  This means, in particular, that it is possible to intercept
      passwords of other users.
    </p>

    <p>
      For security reasons when you use <a
      href="module.html#authorization"><code>wnauth</code></a> or any "<a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.authorization-module"><code>Authorization-Module=</code></a>"
      <strong>you are required to use either the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a> or <a
      href="appendixA1.html#T_opt"><code>-T</code></a> option or the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#a_opt"><code>-a</code></a> or <a
      href="appendixA1.html#a_opt"><code>-A</code></a> option</strong> when the
      server is run and to have the <code>index.cache</code> file in the
      protected directory owned by the trusted user or group. This is to guard
      against counterfeit authentication modules.
    </p>

    <p>
      This particular problem is remedied by the "Digest" authentication
      scheme.  Digest authentication is <a
      href="http://hopf.math.northwestern.edu/digestauth/index.html">supported
      experimentally</a> by <em>WN</em> but has the rather severe drawback that
      no publicly available clients currently support it.  It is experimental,
      because I have no client to test it and hence it has barely been tested.
      I believe it will be a standard part of <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/Protocols/">HTTP/1.1</a> and at that time will
      significantly improve security of password protected directories.
    </p>

    <p>
      The directive "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.authorization-realm">Authorization-Realm=</a></code>",
      used whenever an authentication module is used, is to notify the client
      that for any document on this server with the same realm as this one, the
      same password/username combination will be valid, so the client need not
      ask the user for a username and password, but can reuse the one supplied
      for the first document with this realm.  For security reasons you should
      always put your host and domain name in the realm.  This may at least
      discourage attempts at other sites to forge your realm in order to
      collect user passwords.  Your users should also be warned never to enter
      their password if the realm displayed when they are prompted for a
      password contains a different hostname than the one in the URL they are
      trying to access.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both Basic authentication and access control by IP address become much
      more vulnerable if the potential attack comes from users who can create
      <code>index.cache</code> files for another part of your server's data
      hierarchy.  I would recommend against trying to use either to protect
      information from users with home pages on your server.
    </p>

    <p>
      If no potentially hostile users can create documents which can be served
      on your system the mechanisms described above provide protection adequate
      for many purposes.  If I were an information provider selling access to a
      collection of information on my server, I would be comfortable using the
      numeric IP address to limit access to my paying customers.  On the other
      hand I would not want any of these mechanisms used to protect my bank
      records.

    <h3>4.4 <a name="recommend">Some Recommended Security
    Configurations</a></h3>

    <p>
      This a list of possible ways you might configure your server by setting
      values in <a href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> and using
      command line arguments.  It assumes that you are running either
      <code>wnsd</code> or <code>wnd</code> on the privileged port 80 and that
      the default value of "<code><a
      href="configmacros.html#USERID">#define&nbsp;USERID</a></code>" and
      "<code><a
      href="configmacros.html#GROUPID">#define&nbsp;GROUPID</a></code>" defined
      in <a href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> have not been
      changed.  This will mean that <code>wnsd</code> will be started as
      <code>root</code>, but will almost immediately switch its privileges to
      those of the unprivileged user <code>nobody</code>.  Likewise if
      <code>wnd</code> is running under the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man8/inetd.8.gz"><code>inetd(8)</code></a>
      system utility we assume that it is set to run with the privileges of
      <code>nobody</code>.
    </p>


    <p>
      The following list of configurations is in decreasing order of security.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        4.4.1 <a name="recommend.no_cgi">Forbid CGI and Only Maintainer
        Trusted</a>
      </dt>
       <dd>
        <p>
          This strongest level of security is achieved by running either
          <code>wnsd</code> (or <code>wnd</code> under the UNIX <a
          href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man8/inetd.8.gz"><code>inetd(8)</code></a>
          system utility) with the <a
          href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a> or <a
          href="appendixA1.html#T_opt"><code>-T</code></a> option and with the
          <a href="appendixA1.html#e_opt"><code>-e</code></a> option and with
          no other options.  For the really paranoid uncommenting the "<code><a
          href="configmacros.html#FORBID_CGI">#define&nbsp;FORBID_CGI</a></code>"
          line in the file <a
          href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> and recompiling
          removes the <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a>
          code from the binary.
        </p>

        <p>
          With these options no <a
          href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> programs or
          filters or program output includes are permitted.  Also the
          <code>POST</code> method is not accepted (an error is returned for a
          <code>POST</code> request).  Furthermore only
          <code>index.cache</code> files owned by the user specified in the <a
          href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a> option are used.
          The server should be run as <code>nobody</code> (the default) and the
          numeric user id specified with <a
          href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a> option should be the
          maintainer's.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt>
        4.4.2 <a name="recommend.only_maintainer">Only Maintainer or Maintainer
        Group Trusted</a>
      </dt>
       <dd>
        <p>
          This is the the strongest level of security if you need the
          functionality of <a
          href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> programs or
          filters or program output as server includes.  This security
          configuration does not allow any user home pages (unless the
          maintainer produces the <code>index.cache</code> file for them).  To
          use this level run <code>wnsd</code> (or <code>wnd</code> under
          <code>inetd(8)</code>) with the <a
          href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a> or <a
          href="appendixA1.html#T_opt"><code>-T</code></a> option and no other
          options.  This places all control in the hands of a single maintainer
          or a "maintainer group".  No document or program output may be served
          unless the maintainer has authorized it by explicit mention in one of
          the <code>index.cache</code> database files.  The server will not
          recognize any <code>index.cache</code> file unless it is owned by the
          maintainer specified with the <a
          href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a> option or the group
          specified with the <a
          href="appendixA1.html#T_opt"><code>-T</code></a> option.  Only one of
          <a href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a> or <a
          href="appendixA1.html#T_opt"><code>-T</code></a> options can be used.
        </p>
      </dd>

       <dt>
        4.4.3 <a name="recommend.only_restricted">Restricted User Serving
        Privileges</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          This permits users on the server host to have and control their own
          home pages and documents, but with a number of limitations.  They
          will not be permitted to run <a
          href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> programs, filters
          or include programs.  Also the server will require that every file
          served (including <a href="parse.html#wrapping">wrappers</a> and <a
          href="parse.html#including">includes</a>) have the same owner as the
          <code>index.cache</code> file which grants it permission to be
          served. This means that users can only serve files which they own.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is configuration is obtained by running with the <a
          href="appendixA1.html#E_opt"><code>-E</code></a> option and the <a
          href="appendixA1.html#u_opt"><code>-u</code></a> option.  The <a
          href="appendixA1.html#E_opt"><code>-E</code></a> option is similar to
          the <a href="appendixA1.html#e_opt"><code>-e</code></a> option except
          that <code>index.cache</code> files owned by a trusted user id or
          trusted group id (set with the <a
          href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a> or <a
          href="appendixA1.html#T_opt"><code>-T</code></a> option) are exempt
          from the restrictions.  The <a
          href="appendixA1.html#u_opt"><code>-u</code></a> option requires that
          in order to be served a file must be owned by the owner of the
          <code>index.cache</code> file which lists it.  Trusted users as
          specified with <a href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a> or
          <a href="appendixA1.html#T_opt"><code>-T</code></a> options are
          exempt from this restriction also.

    <h3>4.5 <a name="other">Other <em>WN</em> Security Measures</a></h3>

    <p>
      One of the security problems encountered with another HTTP server
      involved an attack by overflowing an internal buffer with data provided
      by the the client in such a way that the (attacking) client could supply
      code that the server executed.  I have, to the best of my ability,
      defended against this in <em>WN</em> code.  All copying of data supplied
      by the client and most copying of data read from the
      <code>index.cache</code> file is done by a function which I wrote and
      which was designed precisely to deal with this threat.  Excess data which
      would overflow is discarded so buffers may contain truncated data, but
      will not be overwritten.
    </p>

    <p>
      Probably the most controversial security "feature" of <em>WN</em> is that
      it greatly restricts the set of characters which can be used in file or
      path names.  Instead of trying to decide which characters are dangerous
      and disallow them, <em>WN</em> has a list of characters presumed safe and
      only allows them.  The currently allowed characters are alphanumeric
      characters and '<code>_</code>', '<code>-</code>', '<code>.</code>',
      '<code>+</code>', '<code>/</code>' and '<code>%</code>'.  The same
      restrictions are applied to the <a
      href="appendixD.html#cgi.PATH_INFO"><code>PATH_INFO</code></a> part of <a
      href="http://linux-howto.com/rfc/rfc1500-1999/rfc1738.txt">URLs</a> for
      <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> programs, except
      that the character '<code>=</code>' is also allowed.  These restrictions
      sometimes cause problems with <a
      href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> programs that like to
      include unusual characters in file names or <a
      href="appendixD.html#cgi.PATH_INFO"><code>PATH_INFO</code></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also the server will attempt to resolve all "<code>../</code>" references
      while staying in the server data hierarchy.  If these references would
      result in a request for a document outside the server data hierarchy the
      request is treated like a request containing illegal path characters.  In
      particular with <a href="setup.html#logging">verbose logging</a> turned
      on, a message like "<code>SECURITY Found bad character (%X hex) in
      path</code>" is logged.
    </p>

    <p>
      To defend against a "denial of service" attack the server will refuse a
      <code>POST</code> request with post data in excess of 10 megabytes.  This
      does not defend against multiple requests with large <code>POST</code>
      data.  The maximum allowed size of <code>POST</code> data can be altered
      by changing the value of <code>MAX_POST_LEN</code> in the file
      <code>config.h</code>
    </p>
