NOTES:

1. Starting with release 2.0.0 there have been some name changes to
be consistent.  The former "swn" is now called "wnsd" and the former
"wn" is now "wnd".  Hopefully this won't be too incovenient.  If it
is you can change the name back after compiling without ill effect.

2. If you are upgrading WN from a version earlier than 1.17.6 you cannot
use your old mime.types file.  The format of this file has changed
to one which is more standard.  A fairly comprehensive mime.types file
(derived from the Debian Linux file) is included in /lib/mime.types.
I recommend you use it or modify it if you desire.  The correct format
is described in this file.

3. Before you run the configure perl script, you may want to place a
copy of your previous config.h file and Makefile in the top level
directory.  The configure script will then take as its default values
the ones you used in the earlier release.  It is still important to
run the configure script as the newer version of config.h it creates
may differ from the old one.

4. After upgrading it is a good idea to rerun wndex on your hierarchy
using the new version of wndex.  The comman "wndex -r -s index"
executed at the top of your data hierarchy will recursively run
wndex in all subdirectories which contain an "index" file.
