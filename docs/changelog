CHANGE LOG for WN package
=========================

-----------------------------------------------
CHANGES from version 2.4.6 to 2.4.7 (6//2005)
-----------------------------------------------
	Added MAC_OS_X to configure script.
	
	Changed MIDLEN in wn/common.h from 2048 to 3*1024.  Most 
	other string lengths are functions of this, e.g.
	SMALLLEN = MIDLEN/8, etc.

	Added /text/calendar mime type with suffix ics to /lib/mime.types
	
-----------------------------------------------
CHANGES from version 2.4.5 to 2.4.6 (1/18/2004)
-----------------------------------------------
	Modified dedot in prequest.c to be more efficient and eliminate
	possible denial of service.

	Fixed bug in get_remote_info in util.c which did not check 
	if NO_DNS_LOG was set for the default log type.

	Fixed two bugs related to syslogging reported (with suggested
	fixes) by Doug Hardie. The first involved closing too many 
	file descriptors at startup, including the one for syslog.
	The second involved the failure of SIGHUP to cause the virtual
	hosts file to be read when syslogging was in use.
	
-----------------------------------------------
CHANGES from version 2.4.4 to 2.4.5 (4/20/2002)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed bug in wn/standalone.c which caused failure to chown
	and chmod suexec key file.  Hence the server would not start.
	This bug has been around a while, but a kernel update caused
	it to start showing up.

	Added audio/mpeg -- mp3 to mime.types file.
	
	Added application/x-java-jnlp-file  --  jnlp to mime.types file.

	Added -i command line option. The options -i 112.123.123.123
	or -i all cause the server to listen for incoming connections
	on interface with IP address or on all interfaces.  This is useful
	only if you have a system with more than one NIC.
	
	Disabled TRACE method by default for security.  It can be enabled
	by editing config.h and setting WN_ENABLE_TRACE to (TRUE).

	Added "#define OPENSSL_NO_KRB5" to wnssl/wnssl.h to get compilation
	to work with new versions of openssl.
	
-----------------------------------------------
CHANGES from version 2.4.3 to 2.4.4 (9/7/2002)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed wn/init.c so that verbose syslog entries end up on a 
	single line each (as they should). Reported by J. Ross

	Also improved error messages in wn/init.c, i.e. more use of
	strerror().

	If wndex cannot open the mime.types file it now complains by
	default unless run with the "quiet" flag.  Before it only 
	complained with the "verbose" flag.

	In wn/send.c write errors with errno = EAGAIN will now sleep
	one second and try again.  The error occurs on some systems 
	with slow network connection.  Reported by Ken Flaxman.

	Moved URL_SCHEME to the set of environment variables provided
	for authentication (in wn/cgi.c).

	Modified daemon_logerr in /wn/init.c to better handle syslog.

	Added -F option to wnsd.  This causes it to be run in the
	foreground instead of the background (useful for things like
	daemontools, I am told).  Contributed by John Mulder.
	
-----------------------------------------------
CHANGES from version 2.4.2 to 2.4.3 (2/11/2002)
-----------------------------------------------
	Added images wn-ssl1.png wn-secure.png and  wn-ssl.png to
	docs/images.  Thanks to RobM.

	Added support for SSL certificate chain files.  Thanks to Mark
	Feenstra.  Usage: You need your cert and a chain file; copy the
	cert to a new file and cat the chain (pem) file to the end of the
	new file. Then add -z chain=./chain.pem to the command
	line. (chain.pem is the new file).

	Fixed bug in wn/init.c which caused a missing space in verbose logs.
	Thanks to Florian Forster.  

	Fixed documentation docs/setup.html to correctly document verbose log
	field for X-Forwarded-For.  Thanks to Florian Forster.  

	Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c which caused incorrect log format for
	documents with access control.  Simplified code for log_logfile
	in wn/init.c.
	
	Added text/css to the file wn/content.h.  It was already in the 
	mime.types file.

	Fixed bug in wn/init.c which caused syslog logging not to be "verbose"
	even when the "-v vsyslog" option was used.  Reported by Jeff Ross.

	Fixed bug in wndex/wndex.c and wndex/content.c which caused Charset=
	file directive to be ignored.  Reported by Gabor Kiss.
	
-----------------------------------------------
CHANGES from version 2.4.1 to 2.4.2 (10/6/2001)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed bug in send.c and wn.c which caused CGI scripts
	which set cookies and then redirected to fail.  Headers
	from the CGI script were not being sent.  Found and fixed
	by Scott Sorrell.

	Fixed bug in wndex/content.c which caused core dump in some
	circumstances when filenames ended in .z or .gz and content
	type was specified.  Reported by Paul Hoffman. 

	In conjunction with the above, the server no longer automatically
	sets a content-encoding.  Content-encoding headers will be sent
	only when specified by Content-encoding= line in the index.wn 
	file.

	Fixed a bug in wndex/wndex.c which caused default charset not
	to be included in the content-type when the content-type was
	specified in the index.wn file.

	Fixed bug in tilde.c which caused failure of user directories
	when TILDE_USER_STRING ended with a '/' 9as in "/people/")
	instead of something like "/~".  Reported by Christopher F. Miller.
	
	Fixed "Location: mailto" again. Reported by John Bolding.
	
-----------------------------------------------
CHANGES from version 2.4.0 to 2.4.1 (8/8/2001)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed Snprint3 -> Snprintf2 bug in wn/send.c

	Fixed bug in cgi.c which caused PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED
	environment variables not to be correctly set in some 
	circumstances when using cgi-handlers.  Reported and 
	diagnosed by Doug Hardie.
	
-----------------------------------------------
CHANGES from version 2.4.0pre3 to 2.4.0 (5/10/2001)
-----------------------------------------------
	Better error messages are logged if suexec fails.
	
CHANGES from version 2.4.0pre2 to 2.4.0pre3 (4/25/2001)
-----------------------------------------------
	Added #include <time.h> to wn.h so RedHat 7.1 works.
	
CHANGES from version 2.4.0pre to 2.4.0pre2 (3/22/2001)
-----------------------------------------------
	WNssl now has its own directory and can be made from the
	top directory by running "make wnssl".
	
	Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c read_dir_info() which caused errors
	which field values contain '=". (reported by M. Neitzel).

	Fixed bug in wndex/wndex.c which broke serveall.
	(reported by D. Duffy and Ken Flaxman).
	
	Fixed bug in wn/init.c which caused compile failures reporting
	"init_mime" not found (reported by many).

	Fixed bug in wn/init.c which caused core dumps in wnsslsd when
	no cert file was available or password was wrong.
	(reported by Mark Feenstra).

	Fixed problem in configure script for IRIX and ranlib
	(reported by RobM).

	Simplified redirect code in wn/parse.c.  All redirects
	are now external.
	
CHANGES from version 2.3.13 to 2.4.0pre (3/11/2001)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed bug in init.c which caused core dump in attempted wn_exit()
	after certain initialization errors.  Thanks to Doug Hardie

	Fixed bug in wn/evalif.c which caused <!-- #if field#N =~ ...
	statements in parsed html to fail.  Thanks to Jim Stewart.
	
	Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c that caused filemodules not to
	work unless the file actually exists or serveall is specified.
	Thanks to Dajo Hein.

	Added documentation to /docs/appendixC.html for "#if environ VAR"
	and some other parsed document #if constructs.

	Added variables URL_SCHEME and WN_KEY (thanks to A. Schippers).
	
CHANGES from version 2.3.12 to 2.3.13 (12/16/2000)
-----------------------------------------------
	Substantial changes have been made to have the "configure"
	script preserve more from an old config.h.  In particular
	the new config.h generated will not be compatible with older
	ones, so using an old one with the new source probably won't
	work.  On the plus side, less hand editing of the new one
	should be required.

	Added support for "default cachefiles".  Look in the file
	/docs/defcache.html to read about the details of this new feature.
	Or see http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/defcache.html.  This new
	chapter to the documentation was contributed by Doug Hardie.
	Thanks Doug!

	Quite a bit of cleanup of #ifdefs in the code.
	
CHANGES from version 2.3.11 to 2.3.12 (12/1/2000)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed bug in wn/init.c that caused wnssld to ignore the
	-p (port) option and always use the default.

	Removed non-standard regular expression character '~'
	in wn/recomp.c to make regular expressions more standard.
	(thanks to G. Kiss)
	
	Fixed bug in wn/send.c which set bogus charset in returns
	from some range requests (thanks to S. Trier).
	
CHANGES from version 2.3.10 to 2.3.11 (9/30/2000)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed bug in wndex/wndex.c that core-dumped during a
	wndex -ar  run in a hierarchy partially without index.wn files.
	Thanks to Martin Neitzel.

	Fixed bug in wn/common.h which had wrong value for default
	port.  This only had an effect in certain redirects.
	
CHANGES from version 2.3.9 to 2.3.10 (8/5/2000)
-----------------------------------------------

	"Attributes=post" directive now allows POST method, but does not
	prevent use of GET method.  To do that you must also use
	"Attributes=noget".

	Fixed bug in wndex/wndex.c that broke the Default-includes,
	Default-List-Includes, and Default-wrapper directives.

	Fixed bug in suexec/suexec.c that made exempt directory fail.
	The WN version of suexec now supports filters run with user 
	permissions.

CHANGES from version 2.3.8 to 2.3.9 (6/17/2000)
-----------------------------------------------
	
	Sander Schippers has modified the suexec program and suggested
	changes needed for WN.  These changes have been made in this
	version and the modified suexec is included.  At the moment this
	will run CGI scripts under a different user/group depending on the
	virtual host used.  The user/group <--> virtual host match up set
	in the virtual hosts file.  The documentation has been updated to
	reflect this and Sander has supplied documenttaion on installing
	suexec.  Subsequently, I have further modified both WN and suexec
	to the extent that any problems are surely my fault not Sander's.
	This is still in pre-beta form, but it would be good to test it.
	To use it, start by editing config.h (look for WN_SU_EXEC).  You
	will also have to edit Makefile and suexec/suexec.h.  You must use
	virtual hosts with suexec.
	
	Virtual hosts now allow you to turn off the possbility of user
	home directories (a feature some of you wanted). See docs/multi.html
	for more information.
		
	Fixed bug in wn/evalif.c which caused bogus "string terminated"
	errors to be logged when some #if constructs (e.g. && and ||)
	were used.  Reported and diagnosed by P. Pennock and 
	D. Simpkinson.

	Fixed bug in wndex/wndex.c where tmpfpath was incorrectly set.
	Thanks to Craig Milo Rogers.

	Error logging is now automatically done in verbose mode.

	Fixed bug in wn.c which caused a slowdown when pdf files were
	served to MSIE using the acrobat plugin.  Reported by Ken Flaxman.
	
	Fixed bug in wn.c which caused an extra erroneous \r\n after a 
	cookie header which is generated by a script.
	
CHANGES from version 2.3.7 to 2.3.8 (4/28/2000)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed bug in wn/init.c which caused crash in wnssl when the
	key file and the cert file were not the same.  Thanks to
	Doug Hardie.

	Improved wn/Makefile.wn.dist to do a better job of finding
	SSL include files.  Thanks to Doug Hardie.

	Moved the #define DEFAULT_SSL_PORT to config.h(.dist) where
	it belongs from wn/wnssl.h. Doug Hardie again.

	Some cleanup of Makefiles and renaming of files.
	
CHANGES from version 2.3.6 to 2.3.7 (4/25/2000)
-----------------------------------------------
	Removed stray diagnostic message from wn/chkauth.c which was
	entered in error log each time authentication was used.
	
CHANGES from version 2.3.5 to 2.3.6 (4/19/2000)
-----------------------------------------------
	Added support for HTTP Via header.  It's contents is now placed
	in the CGI variable HTTP_VIA.
	
	Fixed bug in wndex/wndex.c which caused ampersands in titles,
 	fields, etc. to not be escaped as they should.  Thanks to Karl
 	Vogel.

	Fixed bug in wndex/wndex.c which caused Default-attributes=md5 to
 	fail to work.  Reported by Jasper Jongmans.

	Fixed bug in wndex/content.c which caused CGI scripts not to have
	the attribute WN_CGI.

	Added support for CGI_EXT_LIST, replacing CGI_EXT.
	
	Fixed bug in wnputh/puth.c where an incorrect macro Snprintf
	caused compiliation errors. Thanks to Craig Milo Rogers.

	Fixed bug in wn/parse.c which caused improper handling
	of complicated wrappers.
	
	Fixed bug in wn/standalone.c where an incorrect clearing of 
	the environment caused server to crash on some systems.
	Thanks to Craig Milo Rogers.

	The configure script now preserves the value of WN_USER which
	you enter when you run the script.  Thanks to Craig Milo Rogers.
	
CHANGES from version 2.3.4 to 2.3.5 (3/10/2000)
-----------------------------------------------
	Added support for the Charset and Default-Charset directives.

	Fixed bug in wnauth/wnauth.c.
	
	Minor bug in wnauth/wn_md5passwd.dist fixed thanks to 
	Frank Denis.
	
CHANGES from version 2.3.3 to 2.3.4 (2/20/2000)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed configure script and wndex/Makefile so that SGI systems
	will not stop because they don't have (and don't need) ranlib.

	Fixed bug in wn/chkauth.c which cause REMOTE_USER environment 
	variable not to be set when Basic authentication is used.

	Modified Makefiles and directory organization.  There is
	now a wn/md5 directory which contains MD5 related code.
	Most of this is now borrowed from openssl. The configure
	script will now try to see if the standard openssl libraries
	have been installed and use them if they have.  WN's own
	MD5 library (which is now from openssl) will also be built
	but should only be used if openssl has not been installed.

	Modified the Set-Cookie directive and added a Default-Cookie
	directive.  In addition to specifying a static cookie you 
	can now start the value with '!' in which case it will be
	interpreted as a script to run to generate the cookie.

	Several mundane changes including new functions fmt2 fmt3 and
	making mystrncat a macro.

	The parameter "meta" is now synonymous with "info".  In other
	words http://host/foo.html;meta does the same thing that
	http://host/foo.html;info has always done.  I bet the "info"
	parameter is an old feature no one knows about.
	
CHANGES from version 2.3.2 to 2.3.3 (2/12/2000)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed some portability problems.  AIX needs time.h and
	it was not being included.

	Added '@' to the characters allowed in the pathinfo part of
	a CGI URL.
	
CHANGES from version 2.3.1 to 2.3.2 (2/9/2000)
-----------------------------------------------
	Modified configure script and wn/Makefile to be more portable
	with the new PAM and wnssl support.  In wn/ there is now a
	Makefile.wn.dist which gets copied with modifications by the
	confingure script.

	Added a README.wnssl with a very brief description of how to
	use it.
	
CHANGES from version 2.3.0 to 2.3.1 (2/5/2000)
-----------------------------------------------
	Modified server so that data reflected to client in
	automatically generated pages is sanitized.  This is 
	was done for internally generated search responses and
	the clients query data returned by <!-- #query -->.
	Data returned from environment variables is NOT sanitized.
	Sanitized means any character except alphanumerics and 
	'.', ':', '/', and '@' are changed to space.

	Integrated wnssl support into base distribution.  This is not yet
 	documented.  You first need to install openssl version 0.9X or
 	later.  Then create a new config.h (or use the old one) and name
 	it "config_ssl.h" (put it in the same directory as "config.h").
  	Then cd to the wn subdirectory and run "make wnssl" optionally
 	followed by "make install_wnssl".

	Added support for PAM (plugable authentication modules)
	in authmodules.  There is a PAM module included in the
	wnauth directory with the same functionality as wnauth.
	To create it install openssl and then in the wnauth directory
	run "make wn_pamauth".
	
	Fixed bug in wn/parse.c which caused "Parse construct to
	large" error to be logged for very large comments 
	(i.e. with "<-- something ... -->") in parsed html.

	Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c (syntax error when WN_IP_ONLY_ACCESS
	is #defined).

	Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c that ended some headers with 
	just \n instead of \r\n.
	
	Attribute 'cacheable' now works for authenticated items.
	
CHANGES from version 2.2.4 to 2.3.0 (12/23/1999)
-----------------------------------------------
	This version contains a rudimentary handler for the
	PUT, DELETE, and MOVE methods ( in the puth/ directory).
	See the documentation for the '-P' option to wnsd and
	the Put-Handler, Put-Authorization-Module, etc. file 
	directives.

	Added new logtype directory directive and new more flexible
	'-v' option for setting log type on the command line.  These
	are described in the documentation.
	
CHANGES from version 2.2.3 to 2.2.4 (12/19/1999)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed bug in wn/cgi.c and wn/tilde.c which caused CGI 
	environment variable to be incorrectly set when a CGI script
	in a user directory is executed.  Reported by Joris Bontje.

	Replaced missing colophone.html file in doc/ directory.
	
CHANGES from version 2.2.2 to 2.2.3 (12/04/99)
-----------------------------------------------
	Added a workaround for bugs in browsers and/or plugins that
	made multipart/byteranges fail.  Either the client or the plugin
	is not strictly adhering to the HTTP spec.  This was causing 
	problems with pdf files, which this workaround fixes.
	
	Support for TRUE64 on Dec Alphas added.  Thanks to Joe Klemmer
	for testing. Also changed names FREE_BSD2 to FREE_BSD and 
	SOLARIS2 to SOLARIS in configure script.

	Fixed bug in wnauth/wnauth which caused it to fail on systems
	with an MD5 based crypt().  Thanks to Kenji Rikitake.  Also
	fixed a bug in wnauth/wn_mkmd5passwd.

	Added a new #define in config.h.dist which turns off persistent
	connections for all POST transactions. This will be the default
	behavior but can be overriden by editing config.h.dist.
	
	Fixed bug in wn/init.c which caused syslog error logging to fail in
	certain circumstances.
	
CHANGES from version 2.2.1 to 2.2.2 (11/5/99)
-----------------------------------------------	
	In honor of "burn all gifs day" (see http://burnallgifs.org/)
	I have replaced all .gif files in the distribution with
	.png files.  The .gif files were probably not legal as I
	have not paid royalties to Unisys and the files were created with
	GPL'd tools.

	I fixed up a couple of other minor problems with the Makefile
	(reported by P. Hoffman) and with the "configure" script.
	
	Some minor revisions and improvements to wnauth were included
	There is no real reason to upgrade to this version if you
	are using 2.2.1 and don't use authentication.
	
CHANGES from version 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 (11/2/99)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed bug in wn/image.c which caused possible buffer overflow.
	This only created a potential vulnerability if you were using
	the builtin imagemap facilities of WN.
	
	CHANGES from version 2.1.7 to 2.2.0 (10/31/99)
-----------------------------------------------

 	Added a few error diagnostics (errno) when logfile openning fails.
	Fixed an obscure bug in wn/util.c.
	Fixed buffer overflow vulnerability in wn/util.c.
	Added further security protections.
	Removed unneeded #include sys/signal.h from mod.c and util.c
	
CHANGES from version 2.1.6 to 2.1.7 (5/12/99)
-----------------------------------------------
	Added support for a new attribute, "no-keepalive".  This causes
 	the server not to use persistent connections after serving a file
 	with this attribute or directory with this default attribute

	Fixed bug in wn/cgi.c that caused REMOTE_ADDR and other environment
	variables not to be set in some circumstances with persistent 
	connections.
	
	Fixed bug in wn/evalif.c which cause parsed #if clauses to fail
	if there was no space between tokens as in 
	<!-- #if hostname=~"quack" -->.	Reported by Jerry Sweet.

	Changed default value of index file from "index" to "index.wn"
	in wndex.  Wndex will still check for "index" if default is
	not found.  Also if the -i option is used the value is saved
	and remembered the next time wndex is run.

	Fixed bug in wn/send.c which caused failure to compile on
	Sun/OS and other systems with no snprintf.
	
CHANGES from version 2.1.5 to 2.1.6 (2/14/99)
-----------------------------------------------
	Added support for the incoming X-Forwarded-For header from
 	proxies.  This is now recorded when verbose logging is done and is
 	put in the CGI environment variable HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR.  Thanks
 	to Kenji Rikitake for supplying the patch to do this.

	Fixed bug in wn/parse.c which caused redirects to mailto: URLs to
 	fail.
	
	Fixed bug in wn/wn.c and wn/send.c that caused redirects (301) not
 	to include content length.  The new version now also includes a
 	short html body about redirects.
	
CHANGES from version 2.1.4 to 2.1.5 (12/12/98)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed bug which made raw documents accessible when handled by
 	CGI-handler or filters (raw = before handled or filtered).  Also
 	fixed bug in wn/cgi.c that in certain circumstances caused the
 	server to try to execute the file to be handled rather than the
 	handler.  Thanks to Peter van Dijk for finding these.

CHANGES from version 2.1.3 to 2.1.4 (12/8/98)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed bug which made source of scripts accessible.  This is
 	serious security issue if you run CGI scripts which contain
 	confidential information.

	Fixed bug in wndex/content.c which caused core dump when
 	Attributes=MD5 was used on a non-existent file.
	
	Fixed bug in wn/parse.c in function dolocation which caused
 	internal redirects to POST documents to fail.

	Fixed bug in wn/tilde.c. If the path to a user's "public_html"
 	directory is longer than 31 bytes it was being truncated and
 	requests for files from that directory failed.
	
CHANGES from version 2.1.2 to 2.1.3 (10/18/98)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed bug in wndex/serveall.c which caused wndex to fail when the
 	-a and -r options were used.  Thanks to Kenji Rikitake.
	
CHANGES from version 2.1.1 to 2.1.2 (10/11/98)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed bug in init.c which caused the last character of the
 	timezone to be truncated in the log file.  Thanks to Kenji
 	Rikitake.
	
CHANGES from version 2.1.0 to 2.1.1 (10/9/98)
-----------------------------------------------

	This file is now called "changelog".
	
	WN now sends the header "Last-Modified" instead of "Last-modified".

	Fixed bug in wn/wn.c where my_id in function remk_postdir() was
 	not set.

	Rewrote functions mystrncpy() and mystrncat() in wn/util.c.  They
 	now have a new semantics and log overflow errors.

	Added support for the HTTP headers TE, Accept-Charset,
 	Accept-Language and Accept-Encoding.  They are put in the
 	environment variables HTTP_TE, HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET,
 	HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE, and HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING respectively.  They
 	can also be matched with conditional #if matching.
	
	Fixed bug in wn/evalif.c which showed up with use of #if language.

	Fixed bug in init.c which caused error logging not to use syslog
	facilities when it should.

	Added support for a CGI environment variable called REMOTE_PORT
	which indicates the port the remote client or proxy is using.
	
CHANGES from version 2.0.2 to 2.1.0 (9/16/98)
-----------------------------------------------
	The wnsd daemon now opens the wnpid file before switching its
	userid to "nobody".  This makes root the owner of wnpid.

	Fixed bug in wn/gsearch.c and wn/csearch.c that caused search
	wrappers to fail when there are multiple search requests in a
	single persistent connection.

	Access files now allow comments (starting with '#') to begin
 	anywhere in a line, not just at the beginning of a line.

	Support for T/TCP in  RFC931 lookups.  Thanks to Kenji Rikitake.

	
***********************************************************************
	
CHANGES from version 2.0.5 to 2.0.6 (2/14/99)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed bug in wn/wn.c which caused "Content-length: 0" not to
	be sent with redirects (status code 301).
	
	Fixed bug in wn/parse.c which caused redirects to mailto: URLs
	to fail.

	Changed keepalive timeout from 20 seconds to 10 seconds.
	
CHANGES from version 2.0.4 to 2.0.5 (12/12/98)
-----------------------------------------------
        Fixed bug which made raw documents accessible when handled
	by CGI-handler or filters (raw = before handled or filtered).
	Also fixed bug in wn/cgi.c that in certain circumstances caused
	the server to try to execute the file to be handled rather
	than the handler.    Thanks to Peter van Dijk for finding these.

        Added release number to cofig.h.dist and Makefile.dist for future
	use.

CHANGES from version 2.0.3 to 2.0.4 (12/7/98)
-----------------------------------------------
	Fixed bug which made source of scripts accessible.  This is
	serious security issue if you run CGI scripts which contain
	confidential information. 

	Fixed bug in wndex/content.c which caused core dump when
	Attributes=MD5 was used on a non-existent file.
	
CHANGES from version 2.0.2 to 2.0.3 (10/9/98)
-----------------------------------------------
	WN now sends the header "Last-Modified" instead of "Last-modified".

	Fixed bug in wn/wn.c where my_id in function remk_postdir() was not set.

	Fixed bug in wn/evalif.c which showed up with use of #if language.

	Fixed bug in init.c which caused error logging not to use syslog
	facilities when it should.
	
CHANGES from version 2.0.1 to 2.0.2 (9/16/98)
-----------------------------------------------
Fixed bug in cgi.c that caused REMOTE_IDENT not to be put in
the environment when it should.

Fixed minor bug in wndex/wndex.c which mishandled lines with 
multiple #'s.
	
CHANGES from version 2.0.0 to 2.0.1 (8/4/98)
-----------------------------------------------
Jean Pierre LeJacq has put in a tremendous amount of work
cleaning and formatting all the WN documentation.  The 
main motivation for this release is to give everyone the
benefits of his work.  We all owe him a big thank you.

Fixed bug that allowed text/plain files to sometimes be
parsed.

Fixed bug in wn/wn.c so that if directory /tmp/wn_tmpdir<uid>
gets removed it is automatically re-created.

Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c that improperly initialized 
handler and filter.

Fixed bug that caused a body to be sent (incorrectly)
in response to certain errors with the HEAD method.

CHANGES from version 1.19.9 to 2.0.0 (5/9/98)
-----------------------------------------------
General cleanup so gcc -Wall provides a clean compile

Removed extern declaration of malloc() and replaced with
appropriate #include.  

Fixed bug that caused MD5 header to be sent on range requests.

Added support for return status 413 "Request entity too large".
This is sent if POST data is larger than 5 meg (MAXPOST in config.h).

Added support for 
  <!-- #if language =~ "regexp" -->

CHANGES from version 1.19.8 to 1.19.9 (5/3/98)
-----------------------------------------------
Redirects now work if nothing has been sent.  I.e.

  <!-- #if whatever -->
       <!-- #redirect =  "http://where_ever" -->
  <!-- #endif  -->

now works.

Implemented Content-MD5 header for static documents.
See Attribute=MD5 in appendixB.html.

Fixed bug in chkcntrl.c which allowed the use of POST 
method only if Attributes=post was set.  This prevented
the use of one script for both GET and POST.

CHANGES from version 1.19.7 to 1.19.8 (3/29/98)
-----------------------------------------------
Fixed bug in vhost.h (missing '=').

Fixed bug in wn.c/chkcntrl.c that caused the server not to
chunk files sent with a filemodule (HTTP/1.1) or not to close the
TCP connection (HTTP/1.0).

Made tempfile for posting more secure.

Added evnironment variables DOCUMENT_ROOT (replacing WN_ROOT)
and SCRIPT_FILENAME

Fixed bug in common.h which caused attibutes=cacheable to 
also set attributes=post

CHANGES from version 1.19.6 to 1.19.7 (2/23/98)
-----------------------------------------------
Added support for <!-- ... parsing constructs which are not
on a line by themselves.  The maximum size allowed for a 
single construct, e.g. "<!-- whatever -->" is 2K.

Fixed bug in wn/wn.c which was not always handling 
NOACCESS and redirects correctly.

Fixed bug in parse.c that caused chunking not to be done when
a parsed text redirect was not done because the condition was
not satisfied.

CHANGES from version 1.19.5 to 1.19.6 (1/25/98)
-----------------------------------------------
Fixed bug in wn/wn.c that caused connections to timeout
after 20 seconds rather than the default of 10 minutes.

Fixed bug that caused transactions to HTTP/1.0 protocol 
instead of 1.1 even if the client is 1.1.

CHANGES from version 1.19.4 to 1.19.5 (1/24/98)
-----------------------------------------------
Added support for && (and) and || (or) in <!-- #if...
clauses in parsed documents.

Added support for the HTTP-Status file directive.  This
is primarily of use when redirecting requests for non-existent
files to an error message which should be returned with
status 404 so robots understand.

Fixed bug in wn/cgi.c which caused Expires header not to be
sent if supplied by the CGI script. Thanks to Kaz Sasayama.

Added support for virtual host nicknames which will be used
in log files with the verbose log format.

Replaced the configure script with a newer one which
deals with -lcrypt better.  In particular it works with
Linux systems using glibc.

CHANGES from version 1.19.3 to 1.19.4 (12/12/97)
-----------------------------------------------
Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c that caused Attributes=serveall
not to work.

CHANGES from version 1.19.2 to 1.19.3 (12/11/97)
-----------------------------------------------

Fixed bug in wn/wn.c that caused the server not to
send the Server: HTTP header.

Fixed a bug in the configure script that caused it
to copy from an old Makefile if present rather than
Makefile.dist.  Also improved the treatment of asking
for the name of the logfile.

CHANGES from version 1.19.1 to 1.19.2 (12/8/97)
-----------------------------------------------

As of this version WN advertises itself as HTTP/1.1 compliant.  I
believe that it is conditionally compliant, but the HTTP/1.1
specification is still a moving target.

Fixed bug in send.c that caused incorrect value in log for
number of bytes sent for responses to byterange requests.

Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c which caused default attributes to
be lost when listed in the index file after a line containing
and explicit Attributes directive.

Added new attributes directive fields, post, put, and nopost.
See docs/appendixB.html for a description of their functionality.

Added a new PARSE_EXT #define in config.h.dist.  It is commented
out by default.  If you uncomment it files ending in "shtml"
will automatically be marked to be parsed without the need of
an Attributes=parse directive.

The authwn module now can be configured to use the NDBM library
and keep username/password pairs in an ndbm data base.  The
older DBM library is no longer supported.  To use NDBM edit
the file authwn/Makefile.

Added support for the HTTP/1.1 OPTIONS method.


CHANGES from version 1.19.0 to 1.19.1 (11/10/97)
-----------------------------------------------
There is a new "-n" option which allows you to set the 
user id under which the server will run at run time.
It must be used with a numeric id.

When the configure script is run the default answers to all
the questions asked will be taken from any older config.h file
which is present in the top level directory. However, the text
of the new config.h and Makefile will be taken from the files
config.h.dist and Makefile.dist respectively.  The old config.h
and Makefile will be moved to config.h.bak and Makefile.bak
respectively.  Previously the actual text was taken  from the
old versions.

Fixed bug in wn/wn.c that caused No-such-file-URL only to be
used when the requested file did not exist.  It should also be used
when the file exists but is not in an index file.

Fixed bugs in sample CGI scripts /docs/examples/nph-sample.cgi
and /docs/examples/push.cgi

Fixed bug in /wn/send.c which caused improper handling 
of client errors in range requests.

Fixed bug that caused the server to attempt to use chunking for
multi-part byteranges.


CHANGES from version 1.18.1 to 1.19.0 (9/8/97)
-----------------------------------------------
Added support for TRACE method and Connection: close for HTTP/1.1

Added support for Transfer-coding: chunked in output.

Fixed bug in wn/csearch.c which caused output of list searches
to incorrectly try to use "connection keepalive."  Also fixed
bug in wn/gsearch.c which caused spurious extra line printed in
search results.

Fixed bug in wn/wn.c which caused incoming headers with
continuation lines to fail.  The extra continuation was 
discarded.

Fixed bug in wn/wn.c which caused wrong error message
for non-existant or forbidden file.

Fixed bug in wn/init.c that caused username not to be logged when
Basic authentication is used.

Fixed bug in wn/wn.c input buffering routines.  Sometimes the
buffer was not being filled when it needed to be.

Added text/css to mime types in wn/content.h and lib/mime.types

Changed wndex so that it now deletes white space before and
after the first '=' in a file directive in the index file.

If the file to be served is a symbolic link and none of the 
options -u, -t, or -T is used then the actual file (i.e. the
one linked to) must be world readable.

CHANGES from version 1.18.0 to 1.18.1 (7/28/97)
-----------------------------------------------
Fixed bug in wn/gsearch.c which caused failure when a context
search was requested with no search term (reported by Hans
de Graaff).

Fixed bug in wn/wn.c which caused a timeout with POST requests
from some versions of Netscape communicator including 4.0.

CHANGES from version 1.17.12 to 1.18.0 (7/25/97)
-----------------------------------------------

Some minor cleanup based on running lint.  The server no longer
sends Title: and Keyword: Headers by default as these are unused.

NOTE: If you are upgrading WN from a version earlier than 1.17.6 you
cannot use your old mime.types file.  The format of this file has
changed to one which is more standard.  A fairly comprehensive
mime.types file (derived from the Debian Linux file) is included in
/lib/mime.types.  I recommend you use it or modify it if you desire.
The correct format is described in this file.


CHANGES from version 1.17.11 to 1.17.12 (7/8/97)
----------------------------------------------- 
Fixed bug in wndex/wndex.c which caused it to convert names of all
include files and default wrapper to lower case. (thanks to S. Trier)

Fixed bug in wndex/wndex.c so it now ignores bogus subdirectories like
"." and ".." and the empty string. (thanks to S. Trier)

The server now checks that any file which is requested and is not
a directory is a regular file.

CHANGES from version 1.17.10 to 1.17.11 (6/5/97)
----------------------------------------------- 

Fixed bug in standalone.c which cause swn to crash on some systems
when it tried to read the MIME type file. (thanks to R. Bixler)

CHANGES from version 1.17.9 to 1.17.10 (6/3/97)
----------------------------------------------- 
WN's byterange requests specified in URLs like
http://host/foo;bytes=111-222 will now give the returned range a
contenet type of application/octet-stream unless the file foo had type
text/* in which case the type of the byte range will be text/plain.

WN now allows you to specify in the configure script if you wish to
allow additional alphabetic characters from the ISO 8859-1 character
set to be used in the URLs WN accepts.  If you choose to allow this
then characters whose decimal value is between 192 and 255 are
allowed.

Fixed bug in standalone.c which cause swn to crash when it tried to read
an invalid MIME type file (e.g. an old format mime.types).
(thanks to R. Bixler)

CHANGES from version 1.17.8 to 1.17.9 (5/14/97)
----------------------------------------------- 
Fixed bug in evalif.c which caused "<!-- #if...file = foo..."
to fail when the file foo of regular expressions contains
items starting with '!'.  Thanks to G. Kiss for a fix.

Fixed bug in wn/wn.c that sometimes truncated multiple range 
requests.  Also added better error handling in wn/send.c sendrange()
function.

Fixed bug in init.c which cause swn to crash when it tried to read
an invalid MIME type file (e.g. an old format mime.types).
(reported by several people)

CHANGES from version 1.17.7 to 1.17.8 (4/18/97)
----------------------------------------------- 
Fixed bug in wn/content.h which would cause wndex to
crash if the mime.types file had additional entries added
by the maintainer.  Thanks to Jean Pierre LeJacq.

Fixed bug in wn/init.c which improperly handled swn's reading of
mime.types files which contain malformed entries.

Included new more extensive mime.types file based on the Debian 
mime.types file.

CHANGES from version 1.17.6 to 1.17.7 (4/14/97)
----------------------------------------------- 
Fixed bug in init.c which caused swn sometimes to crash on startup
because a random pointer was freed in init_mime(). Thanks to G. Gallo.

Added support for SINIX OS. Thanks to S. Witzel.

Fixed bug in isearch.c.  Search modules were not properly closed.
Thanks to S. Bailey.

CHANGES from version 1.17.5 to 1.17.6 (4/2/97)
----------------------------------------------- 

Added new List-Includes functionality (see the User's Guide)

Swn will now read the mime.types file when it is started or restarted
(with "kill -HUP pid").  Wn does not do this.  Also swn only takes
note of new suffixes and their mime types. You cannot change the mime
type corresponding to one of the standard suffixes (as listed in the
default mime.types file). To do that you need to change the server
source and recompile.

Keyword/Title searches into access restricted subdirectories now
work better.  Instead of simply denying access, the restrictions
are now checked.


CHANGES from version 1.17.4 to 1.17.5 (3/4/97)
----------------------------------------------- 
Logging now does a better job with the bytes sent field.  CGI and
other dynamic documents are now included.  Headers are now included
in the count so the bytes sent will be slightly larger than the file size.

Fixed bug in wn/init.c that caused logging with syslog to sometimes
omit host name and only use IP address.  (reported by D. Capshaw)

Fixed bug in wn/csearch.c that caused titles and filenames of restricted
files to be sometimes returned in the results of a title search even
when access should not be allowed.

Fixed bug that sometimes caused port number to be added twice when
a redirect is done.

CHANGES from version 1.17.3 to 1.17.4 (2/17/97)
----------------------------------------------- 

CGI-handler.  This is a way to designate a CGI-script to handle a file
somewhat like a filter.  The name of the script need not be in the URL
since is in the index file.  So when http://host/foo.html is requested
this will cause the "handler", say bar.cgi, to be run with Pathinfo
set to /foo.html. It is useful if you want all files in a directory to
be handled by the same CGI script.  More details will be in the
user's guide.

Fixed bug in authwn/authwn.c that caused things like
"Authmodule=~/bin/authwn ~/dir/passwd" to sometimes fail
because the '~' did not correctly expand to the WN root
data directory.

Fixed bug in wn/parse.c that caused #includes within #sections
sometimes to fail.  (Reported by David Robley).

Fixed bug in wn/parse.c that caused nomatchsub files not to
be parsed. (reported by G. Anker and G. Retti).

Fixed bug in wndex/wndex.c that caused escaped ampersands in
a URL= directive not to be properly handled. (Reported by G.
Anker)
 
CHANGES from version 1.17.2 to 1.17.3 (1/14/97)
----------------------------------------------- 

There are several new features for wndex.  Using the new "-s index"
option with an index file containing no Subdirs= directive is
equivalent having such a directive whose value is a list of all
subdirectories which contain an index file.  Using the "-s all" option
is similar except all subdirectories are used.  Also "wndex -a" can
be run with no index file and is equivalent to having an index file
containing only "Attributes=serveall".  This is useful when wndex is
used recursively.  There is a new manual appendix at
http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/appendixA2.html which lists all the
command line options (old and new) for wndex.

Rewrote the #if-else-endif parsing.  It now supports <!-- #elif -->.

Fixed bug in gsearch that caused attempt to parse plain text documents
for things like <!-- #if... when doing a context search.

Fixed bug in wn/send.c which caused timeout after 600 seconds even 
if progress was being made in file transfer.


CHANGES from version 1.17.1 to 1.17.2 (12/11/96)
-----------------------------------------------
Increased the default maximum size of POST data from 2 meg. to 
5 meg.  Changed value of QUEBACKLOG in standalone.c from 5 to 1024.

authwn now recognizes the groupfile format used by apache as well
as the one described in the documentation.

The file directive 
     Attributes=noncachable
now indicates that the server should send the "Pragma: no-cache" and
"Cache-control: no-cache" headers attempting to encourage clients and
proxies not to cache this document.  It is not necessary to set this
for CGI scripts as it is set by default for them.  Use of
Attributes=dynamic also implies a default of noncachable. If you wish
to allow the output of a CGI script to be cached then use the line
     Attributes=cachable
which will override this default.

Fixed bug in /wndex/wndex.c so that wndex now recognizes the 
Default-Wrapper directive.  Thanks to Jose Manuel Cerqueira Esteves.

Fixed bugs in wn/prequest.c and wn/parse.c so that redirects 
now work properly with virtual hosting. I.e. they default to
the hostname specified in a Host: header rather than the compiled
in hostname.

Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c so that Default-content and
Default-attributes now works with "serveall" files.

Fixed bug in wn/parse.c which caused search wrappers not to
be parsed.

Wndex now recognizes a different format for mime.types as well
as the old one.  See the documentation.

CHANGES from version 1.17.0 to 1.17.1 (11/9/96)
-----------------------------------------------
Fixed bug in wn/prequest.c that caused virtual hosting to work 
improperly when a URL with an IP number instead of a hostname 
is processesd.

Fixed bug in wn/parse.c which caused the server to try to parse
<!-- #if ... -->  lines in text/plain files.  Reported by Scott McMullan.

Fixed bug in wn/common.h.  OUT_BUFFSIZE was #defined to be (128).  It
should be (4096).

CHANGES from version 1.16.0 to 1.17.0 (10/29/96)
-----------------------------------------------

Fixed bug in send.c which the file being sent to be closed twice. This
caused problems on some linux systems.

Fixed bug in send.c that caused the Filter= directive only to work if
its complete path name from the server root was given.

Fixed bug in configure script which caused it to add extra
"-O3" arguments to the CFLAGS variable in the Makefile.  Thanks
to J. Norden.

Added support for the "Max-Age" and "Default-Max-Age" directives. For
example, "Max-age=3 weeks" will cause the Expires header to be set for
a date 3 weeks after the document is served.  The units seconds,
minutes, hours, and days are permitted in place of weeks (but multiple
units like "3 days and 2 hours" are not allowed). Also the directive
"Max-age=3 weeks after last-mod" will cause the Expires header to be
set to 3 weeks after the last-modified date of the file.

Added support for <!-- #if after [date] --> and
<!-- #if before [date] --> parsing instructions 
see docs/appendixC.html.

Added support for directives Default-Includes and Default-Wrappers.
For more information see docs/appendixB.html.

The search type can now be set in a forms field called "mode".
For more details see http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/docs/search.html#mode

CHANGES from version 1.15.8 to 1.16.0 (10/10/96)
-----------------------------------------------
There is a new CGI environment variable URL_SCHEME which contains
"http" if a normal wn or swn is being run or "https" if the server
has been patched to use secure sockets layer (SSL).

The temp file used by wndex is now name "indxcach.tmp" by default
so it works on filesystems which require 8.3 names.

Fixed bug in wndex which caused it to list "indxcach.tmp" in the 
index.cache file if the serveall directive is used.  (Thanks to
P. DuBois)

CHANGES from version 1.15.7 to 1.15.8 (9/14/96)
-----------------------------------------------
Version 1.15.7 erroneously contained many of files from 1.15.6.  It
will run fine but the fixes listed for 1.15.7 won't actually work 
until you get 1.15.8.

Fixed mistake in /docs/examples/shape.map -- a missing point in the
polygon description (thanks to I. To).

Fixed bug in chkauth.c that caused sporadic authentication problems with
IRIX systems (thanks to P. Tyers).

CHANGES from version 1.15.6 to 1.15.7 (9/12/96)
-----------------------------------------------
Fixed bug that caused turning off persistent connections to fail.
To turn them off #define NO_KEEPALIVE in config.h

Created timeout for authwn.  Also REMOTE_USER and AUTH_TYPE should
now be set for authentication modules.

Fixed bug that caused "write error" to be logged in error log whenever
the remote client disonnected in mid transaction.

Improved wn/Makefile.

CHANGES from version 1.15.5 to 1.15.6 (8/25/96)
-----------------------------------------------
Rewrote much of the low level buffering for file output.  This needed
doing anyway, but an interesting paper by John Heidemann at
http://www.isi.edu/lsam/publications/phttp_tcp_interactions/paper.html
was a prime motivator.  The two suggestions suggested in this 
article are incorporated in this version. 

CHANGES from version 1.15.4 to 1.15.5 (8/22/96)
-----------------------------------------------

Added support for the NCSA extended log format.  This is invoked
with the -v option as in "-v <logtype>" where <logtype> is one of
"common", "verbose", or "ncsa."  NOTE: THIS IS AN INCOMPATIBLE
CHANGE TO THE -v OPTION.

Fixed bug in isearch.c which caused Content-Length header to
be sent for search results.  It shouldn't be sent.  Also fixed
the same thing for line ranges. (reported by R. Bixler)

Fixed bug in wn/prequest.c so virtual host name comparison is
not case sensitive. (thanks to A. Roelofs)

Fixed bug in wn/wn.c thiscon.authuser and thiscon.rfc931name were
not properly initialized.

Fixed bug in wn/wn.c, to actually have the "Netscape hanging" bug
fix take effect.

Fixed bug in wn/send.c which caused some redirected documents to be
logged twice.

Fixed bug in handling of redirects with '#' in anchor
(thanks to D. Capshaw).

Added support for <!-- #if field3 ~ regexp -->. (Thanks to S. Trier)

Added support for the CGI environment variables AUTH_TYPE, 
HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE and HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET.


CHANGES from version 1.15.3 to 1.15.4 (7/28/96)
-----------------------------------------------

Fixed bug in wn/chkcntl.c that failed to make CGI docs dynamic
when they should be. (Reported by Roy Bixler)

With substantial help from D. Capshaw I think the "Netscape hanging"
bug is fixed.

Fixed bug in wndex/serveall.c which caused the temp file "index.cache.temp"
to be listed in the index.cache file when Attributes=serveall is used.
(Reported by P. DuBois)

Fixed bug in wn/parse.c.  The array bigbuf[] was not properly 
initialized. (Thanks to I. Levinson)

Rewrote "get_input" in wn/wn.c to read() rather than fgets().

Added support for a group file to authwn.  See docs/access.html.

The configure script now asks if you want persistent connections.
The default is yes for 1.15.x and no for 1.14.x

CHANGES from version 1.15.2 to 1.15.3 (7/11/96)
-----------------------------------------------

Fixed distribution which was not assembled properly for 1.15.2
(i.e. it had some old files so all the fixes weren't there).

Fixed bug in wn/parse.c.  The array bigbuf[] was not properly 
initialized. (Thanks to I. Levinson)

CHANGES from version 1.15.1 to 1.15.2 (7/8/96)
-------------------------------------------
Fixed bug in chkcntrl.c that caused filemodules to fail. They
now also work with Attributes=serveall (thanks to W. Zekoll)

Fixed bug in chkcntrl.c which caused a segmentation fault if a request
for a file in a non-existent directory was received. (reported by
N. Walsh)

Fixed bug in wn/cgi.c which caused sporadic failures for simple /bin/sh
CGI scripts. (reported by S. Trier).

Fixed wn/gsearch.c which produced some HTML in search responses which 
was not legal.

Fixed bug in wn/wn.c which made Accept-Ranges header wrong causing
PDF files to fail with Netscape plugin.

CHANGES from version 1.15.0 to 1.15.1 (6/12/96)
-------------------------------------------

Fixed bug in wn/image.c which caused the "point" method to sometimes
fail.

Fixed bug in wn/init.c which caused the error logging to always fail.

Added support for multiple byteranges with the Range: header.

CHANGES from version 1.14.2 to 1.15.0 (6/4/96)
-------------------------------------------

Implemented "lazy logging".  DNS lookups and logging now take place
after the end of a connection.  (A connection may be persistent and
include several transactions.)  This can cause an improvement in user
peceived speed.  It is not really more efficient since the same work
must be done, it is just done after the document is transmitted.

Increased constants in wndex/serveall.c to allow more files in 
a directory using serveall.

CHANGES from version 1.14.1 to 1.14.2 (6/4/96)
-------------------------------------------

Added feature to wndex suggested by many to have it write initially
an index.cache.temp file and then use rename() to move that to 
index.cache when it is finished.

Fixed bug in wn/wn.c which caused http_prolog() to give an incorrect
zero content length header in 401 (not authorized) responses.

CHANGES from version 1.14.0 to 1.14.1 (5/31/96)
-------------------------------------------

Improved portability for SOLARIS2 and AIX.  I.e. AIX now compiles
correctly and Solaris works with cc (before it worked with gcc).

Fixed wndex so it no longer issues warning when a redirected
file does not exist and has no title.

Fixed bug in "configure" that caused it not to ask for a
substitute value for "public_html" when using the TILDE_TABLE feature.
Also "configure" now asks if you are using gcc or cc.  This is
necessary for proper configuration of Solaris.

A number of documentation improvements.  Many typos fixed
thanks to C. M. Rogers.

Fixed bug in cgi.c that could have caused the loss of some bytes
from CGI output in some circumstances. (Thanks to U. Pfeifer)

Put timehack() back in standalone.c -- somehow it got lost between
1.09 and 1.10.  This is a dummy lookup of time and DNS stuff, done
once when the server starts up to get some standard info from the
system.  It should improve performance slightly.

CHANGES from version 1.13.5 to 1.14.0 (5/24/96)
------------------------------------------- 

Fixed bug in do_list_search() from wn/csearch.c which caused list
searches to create an incorrect form at the end of matches.

Fixed problem in wndex/content.c which caused compile to fail
on systems for which NEED_STRCASECMP is defined. (reported
by H. MacEwan).

Fixed bug in wn/prequest.c which caused looping when requests like
http://host/cgi-bin/dir/foo are made.  CGI scripts must be in a
directory named cgi-bin or end with suffix .cgi.  The file manual
section /docs/cgi.html now emphasizes this.

Fixed problem in wn/parse.c which caused the Default-document
directive to fail when used in users' directories, i.e. with URL's
like "http://host/~user/".  (reported by H. MacEwan and U. Pfeifer).

Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c that caused incorrect value of directory
owner in Link: headers.

Fixed bug in wn/common.h to make ".tex" files have content type
text/plain.

Changed date format for Date: and Last-Modified: headers to be
consistent with RFC 1123.

Fixed bug that caused NO_SUCH_FILE URL redirection not to work when
the non-existent file is in a non-existent directory. (reported by
K. Lyon)

Added support for <!-- #host_header --> conditional inclusion based
on virtual hostname (see docs/appendixC.html).

CHANGES from version 1.13.4 to 1.13.5 (5/6/96)
-------------------------------------------

Fixed bug in init.c which caused compile failure when
USE_VIRTUAL_HOSTS is #defined, but VIRTUAL_HOSTS_FILE is not.

Fixed bug int wn/wn.c and wn/chkcntrl.c which caused error message
not to be sent when a non-existent file was requested and no custom
error message had be specified (reported by H. MacEwan).

Improved compatibilty for RISCOS (thanks to P. DuBois).

CHANGES from version 1.13.3 to 1.13.4 (4/29/96)
------------------------------------------- 

The "virtual hosts" feature of the WN server has been enhanced
in two ways.  First it is now possible to use a file containing
a list of virtual host names, their IP addresses and the 
data root directory for each.  Secondly the server now supports
the "Host: " header implemented by some browsers (e.g. Netscape2.x)
and so-called "full URLs".  For browsers that support either of these
features it is now possible to have multiple virtual hosts with a
single IP address!  The HTTP/1.1 protocol will require browsers to
support the Host: header.

Fixed bugs in parse.c which caused redirects with "#" to fail
and caused <!-- #environ="whatever" --> to fail.

Fixed bug which caused error logging to sometimes fail when
call to getpeername fails.

Imagemap changes: A file named foo.map (i.e. with suffix .map) will
automatically be considerd to have "Attributes=imagemap" set when
wndex is run unless a "Content-type=whatever" line is supplied for it.
This will also work if "serveall" is specified and there is no entry
for foo.map.  But it is necessary to run wndex, i.e. the server will
not recognize foo.map as an imagemap file if wndex has not been run
on the directory containing it.

There are three new per directory directives which may be placed
in index files.

     Access-denied-URL=http://host/dir/foo.html
     No-Such-File-URL=http://host/dir/foo.html
     Auth-denied-file=~/dir/foo.html

The first is a URL to which to redirect if the request is denied
because of an accessfile restriction.  The second it a URL to which
redirect a request for a non-existent file.  The third is a file containing
an HTML doc to use as an error message which password authentication
fails.  See /docs/appendixB.html for more details.

Fixed bug in send.c which caused rewriting of same data when there
is a partial write.  (reported by T. William Wells)

Fixed bug in csearch.c (reported by P. DuBois) and bug in standalone.c
(reported by J. Polterock)


CHANGES from version 1.13.2 to 1.13.3 (3/7/96)
------------------------------------------- 
There have been some significant changes with the serveall attribute.
A minor change is that it is no longer the case that non world readable
documents will not be served.  Now any document readable by the server
will be served unless it ends in '~' or starts with '.'.  The big change
is that  now running wndex in a directory with attribute=serveall enters
all the servable documents in the index.cache file.  This means they
are all searchable and that HTML files among them will have the correct
title.

Changed Allow-Range: header to Accept-Range: header per spec change.

Fixed bug that caused wrong document root to be used sometimes if the
document root was changed in the middle of a multi-request connection.

Fixed bug that made caused content length header to be off by one
in range requests of the form "bytes=n-".

Fixed bug that caused some spurious Write Error messages to be logged
and that caused some images to "hang".

Fixed bug in wndex/wndex.c that caused Default-Attributes to fail.
(Thanks to Hans de Graaff).

Fixed bug that caused some repeated simple searches to fail because
the URL might have two "query=" strings at the end.

Fixed bug that caused by a NULL value of errlogfp.

CHANGES from version 1.13.1 to 1.13.2 (2/17/96)
------------------------------------------- 

Added support for a new additional format in access files restricting
directory access to certain hosts.  The new format for a line in an
access file is

	nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/mmm.mmm.mmm.mmm

consisting of an IP net address and an IP mask.  The procedure is to
take the IP address of the remote client, do a logical "and" of each
of its four parts with the four parts of the mask (mmm.mmm.mmm.mmm)
and check that the four results agree with the four parts of
nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn.  For example, the line "123.123.123.0/255.255.255.0"
will match (and allow access to) precisely those machines with IP
address of the form 123.123.123.x because the "x" part is "anded" with
0 and hence becomes 0, while the other four parts are anded with 
255 and hence unchanged, so they must all equal 123.

Added support for <!-- #environ = "WHATEVER" --> to include the
contents of any environment variable in a parsed HTML document.

Added support for a new command line argument "-q pidfile" 
which specifies the name of a file in which the server puts
its process id rather than printing it to standard output.
This filename can also be specified when the configure script is
run.  For more details see docs/access.html.

Any redirection to a URL containing "#whatever" is now sent out
as an HTTP 302 redirect and not done locally.

Fixed bug in wn/parse.c which broke imagemaps on some systems.

Fixed bug in wn/parse.c which caused <!-- #field#n --> not to work.

Fixed bug in wn/prequest.c which caused markline documents to 
have incorrect Content-Length.

Fixed bug in chkcntrl.c which caused CGI documents not to be marked
dynamic when they occur in an index file with attribute=serveall set.

Hopefully fixed bug which caused documents to be truncated when they
were included in wrappers which are executed or used includes which were
executed.

CHANGES from version 1.13.0 to 1.13.1 (1/17/96)
-------------------------------------------
Fixed bug in standalone.c which caused SYSV systems to fail to compile
with an "undeclared function zombie..." error.

Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c and wn/wn.c whicn caused "Default-Document" and 
"Default-Content" directives to fail.

If a Redirect directive is given with a trailing '?' as in
Redirect=http://host/foo?
Then the server will append the "query" part of the original request
before doing the redirect.  The query part is anything after a '?'
in the URL.  This applies also to <!-- #redirect... lines in parsed
documents and to URL's in imagemap files (in imagemap files the 
query information is always the x and y co-ordinates on which the
user clicked).

Fixed bug in wn/csearch.c which caused HTTP/1.0 headers not to be
sent for server generated documents requesting a search term.

Fixed bug that caused tmp files from POST method sometimes not to
be removed (reported by G. Retti).

Added support for Unless-Modified-Since: header with Range: header.

All documents for which authentication is required are now marked as
dynamic by default to discourage clients and proxies from caching
them.  This can be overridden with the non-dynamic attribute.

Added ".class" entry (for java applets) to content.h and lib/mime.types

Added HTTP_HOST to CGI environment variables.  This is the content of the
Host: header (if any) supplied by the client.  It should contain the name
of the alias for *your* host which the client got from the URL.  When all
clients provide this virtual servers will be possible without multiple
IP addresses.  It is now supported by Netscape 2.0 and perhaps others.

CHANGES from version 1.12.3 to 1.13.0 (12/15/95)
-------------------------------------------
Added -d command line option which causes all headers etc. from client 
to be copied in logfile.  Use sparingly.  (thanks to Jeff Norden)

Added wn_pipeclosed() function to wn.c to log something when client
breaks connection.  (thanks to Jeff Norden)

Added support for "privileged sites" in access files.  If you list
a site in an access file with a '+' prefix like

	+hopf.math.nwu.edu
	+123.123.123.1

then requests from that site will be exempt from any password requirements.
I.e. no username/password is required for requests from privileged sites,
but may be required from other sites.

Added support for byte ranges of the form bytes=123-  and bytes=-123
(see docs/range.html).  Also support for "Range:" header.  The Range:
header will be appearing in browsers and will allow things like 
restarting broken connections.

Support for Connection: Keep-Alive.  This only is for static documents
(no CGI's, filtered or parsed docs -- that will have to wait for 
standards/browser support).  Keep-alive can be disabled by uncommenting
the "#define NO_KEEP_ALIVE" line in config.h.

Default-attributes directive for directories is now available.
This involves a minor change in the format of index.cache files.
Currently the server can read both the new and old formats, but
this will change eventually.  So it is a good idea to rerun
wndex (or wndex -r) on your files to produce index.cache files
in the new format.  See the manual section Appendix B.

Verbose logging when using a multi-home server now labels each
log entry with the IP address of the interface used rather than
just an integer.

Added -b option to bin/digest which causes it to use byte ranges
instead of line ranges (Thanks to Paul Dubois).  The number of bytes
actually sent is logged for a byte range request but this field is
omitted for a line range request.

Better handling of zombie elimination for some systems (thanks to
Kurt Siegl).

CHANGES from version 1.12.2 to 1.12.3 (12/11/95)
-------------------------------------------
Fixed bug in standalone.c which caused identd logging to fail for
swn when hostname was specified in config.h or on command line.

Moved the #include "../config.h" out of wn.h and into the beginning of
each of the source files.  This solves some portability problems with
NEXT, e.g.


CHANGES from version 1.12.1 to 1.12.2 (11/30/95)
-------------------------------------------

Fixed bug in wn/tilde.c which treated /~user requests incorrectly
when a non-existent user was requested and TILDE_TABLE was set in
config.h  (thanks to Paul Dubois)

Better flushing of output in parsed documents (change to parse.c).

You can now search for entities like &atilde; in HTML docs with
context searches.

Fixed bug which caused spurious "Getsockname failed" error logs
when using RFC931 ident services.


CHANGES from version 1.12 to 1.12.1 (11/15/95)
-------------------------------------------
Fixed bug in init.c (start_log should do nothing if not logging or 
usgin syslog).

Fixed bug in wn.c which caused compilation problems on systems with
SOCKADDR and SET_INTERFACE_ROOT set (e.g. Solaris and linux)

CHANGES from version 1.11 to 1.12 (10/23/95)
-------------------------------------------
Fixed multiple bugs in chkauth.c which caused "Basic authentication"
to fail on some systems.

Fixed problem in prequest.c which caused requests like http://host/;info
to fail if root directory had a default document.

Added -v command line option to toggle verbose/non-verbose logging.
With -v the server does the opposite of the compiled in default.


CHANGES from version 1.10 to 1.11 (10/16/95)
-------------------------------------------
Fixed several problems in wn/init.c including one which prevented 
error logging and the omission of the #include<sys/signal.h> line.

Removed a few unused variables reported by lint.


CHANGES from version 1.09 to 1.10 (10/15/95)
-------------------------------------------
Changed authwn again.  It should be a little more secure now.  This
should have no effect except you can't use pre 1.10 versions of authwn
with the server.  I also fixed a bug in authwn.c so it now ignores
a second ':' and everything after it in a line of the password file.
This allows lines of the form "usr:encrypted_password:other_comments.

There is now a cgi-bin compatibility feature.  If any directory is
named cgi-bin then every file served from it is assumed to be a CGI
script.  Files are served in the usual way.

Added support for <!-- #if request =~ "pattern" --> which works like
other conditional parsed text but matches against clients request.
BTW either =~ or ~ works in these conditional parsing constructs.
I have decided that =~ is better so I changed the documentation to
reflect that.

If swn receives a HUP signal (via "kill -HUP server_pid") it
will close the logfiles and then reopen them.  This is useful for
logfile rotation scripts.  This will have an effect only if the
logfiles have been moved with "mv" before the kill -HUP is done.
(Thanks to George Headley)

To help with this swn will now print its pid to standard output
when it it starts.  Thus invoking it with a command like
"swn <options> /path/wnroot > /path/wn.pid" will put the process
id of the server in the file /path/wn.pid for use in logfile scripts
(See /docs/setup.html#logging).

If the server gets its hostname from config.h or the command line
it will now get the appropriate IP address from gethostbyname().
This allows running multiple instances of the server on the same
port, but with different IP addresses.  See docs/multi.html.
(Thanks to George Headley)

Timeouts are now logged in the main logfile not the error logfile.
The error logfile is intended for potential problems of which the
maintainer should be aware.  Thus while timeouts aren't exactly normal
they usually don't indicate a server problem.

There is a new environment variable set for CGI scripts.  It is called
HTTP_POST_FILE and contains the path to a file containing the data
posted by the client.  The file is removed after the CGI script exits.
This is intended for use with the new file upload capability of the
Netscape browser (and hopefully others).  CGI scripts should be able
to rename or copy this file (of course the content of the file is
still avaiable on standard input).  Note that there is a maximum
allowable size for a post which is currently 1 meg.  This can
be changed by altering the value of the MAX_POST #define in wn/wn.c.

You can now put multiple attributes in a single attribute directive
separated by commas.  I.e. Attributes=nosearch, parse, dynamic
is equivalent to 3 separate Attributes lines with the values 
nosearch, parse, dynamic.  Note that "Attrtibutes=" (with the 's')
is equivalent to "Attribute=".

CHANGES from version 1.08 to 1.09 (9/20/95)
-------------------------------------------

The HTTP_AUTHORIZATION environment variable is gone.  The
authorization header information is now communicated to authorization
modules by first URL-encoding it and then passing it as the first
(command line) argument.  This means that wn 1.09 is not compatible
with versions of authwn which are pre-1.09.  Sorry.  Of course wn-1.09
works with authwn wn-1.09 and no changes in your index file should be
needed.


BUT: Henceforth authwn and other Authorization-Modules can only be
used when the server is run with the -t or the -T option or the (new)
-a or -A option and with the trusted user or group the owner of the
index.cache file listing the Authorization-Module.  This is to protect
against counterfeit Authorization-Modules.

Fixed bug in wn/standalone.c caused by typo.  It should be 
daemon_logerr not daemon)logerr. (Thanks to P. Dubois).

Fixed bug in parse.c which caused context search references (things
with #WN_mark) to fail when they were parsed.  (Reported by R. Firth)

When a redirect is done because a trailing '/' has been left off the
request the :port is left off if port = 80.  I.e. if the old redirect
to http://host:80/dir/index.html will now be http://host/dir/index.html.

When a '/' is tacked on the end of a file (not directory) URL then
access is now denied. (reported by G. Retti)

Fixed bug which caused <!-- #redirect --> to fail if redirect was local
and file redirected to contained #includes. (reported by J. van Wezel)

Fixed bug in wn/csearch.c which caused title searches sometimes to 
return matches from directories which were marked with Attribute=nosearch.

wndex no longer warns about empty fields for Field#= if it is run with
the -q (quiet) option.


CHANGES from version 1.07 to 1.08 (8/30/95)
-------------------------------------------

Added support for use of a "<null>" URL in an imagemap file.  This
causes the server to send a status 204 "no response" header which tells the
client to do nothing and leave the display alone.  This means in imagemaps
you can have a region (say the background) where nothing will happen
if the user clicks.  The page won't be reloaded and won't change.
You can also use "Redirect=<null>" lines in a file record of an index
file.

Added support for a new directory directive, "Default-Document".  Now
a line like "Default-Document=foo.html" in an index file in /dir will 
mean that http://host/dir/  will return foo.html instead of index.html.
This is especially useful if you want to use a CGI script as the default
document.

Added Appendix E to documentation.  This is a document for users
who are not webmasters on how to set up a homepage in their own
directory (assuming the "/~user" stuff has been enabled.

Fixed bug in wn/standalone.c which caused swn to die sometimes
when an accept() system call fails.

Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c which sent inappropriate error when
a line in an accessfile does not end in a \n.

Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c which caused problems with Attributes=serveall
and files ending in .z or .gz not being properly typed.  Also unrecoginized
suffixes caused a core dump.

Fixed bug in wndex/content.c which caused wndex to fail to extract
items properly from <META> lines in HTML docs. (thanks to G. Anker)

Added support for ISC systems to configure script (thanks to J. Bailey)

Added support for "nocoords" in ismap support.  This allows non-graphical
browsers to be sent a message when an ismap graphic is selected.
(thanks to S. Trier)

In conditionally included text like <!-- #if accessfile = "foo" 
errors (like inability to open foo) now result in denying access to
both the "if" and "else" text segments.

Fixed bug in wndex/wndex.c which caused it to put an extra & in index.cache
in some circumstances.

Added support for new file attributes "dynamic" and "non-dynamic"
(see Appendix B of user's guide for more details).

Fixed bug in wn/prequest.c which caused context searches of files
(as opposed to directories) to fail.  (Thanks to Chris Dalton).

Fixed bug in wn/gsearch.c which in some cases used fclose on a fd
obtained by popen(). (Thanks to N. Readwin)



CHANGES from version 1.06 to 1.07 (7/22/95)
-------------------------------------------
Fixed bug that caused <!-- #query -->, <!-- #title -->, etc. not to
work in searchwrappers and nomatchsubs.

Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c (directory attributes were not initialized
so, for example, some directories were marked non-searchable which
should not have been).

Fixed bug in wn/util.c in get_rmote_info() which caused failure to
send error message when a bad ~user URL is requested.

Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c in chkaccess() which exited when accessfile
could not be opened instead of treating it like an access denial.

Added built in support for imagemaps. Just put a standard mapfile
in your index with the "Attribute=imagemap" and make an ISMAP anchor
point to it instead of the imagemap program.  See docs/click.html
and docs/examples/ismap.html.

Added support for <!-- #if query ~ "regexp" --> in parsed documents.

Added support for <!-- #redirect="some_url" --> in parsed documents.
If this is encountered in a parsed document and no text has been sent
then a redirection to "some_url" will be done.  E.G.
<!-- #if hostname ~ ".*.uk" -->
	<!-- #redirect =  "uk_mirror_url" -->
<!-- #endif -->
[Real document here]

If verbose logging is used the HTTP Cookie is now logged if it is present.

CHANGES from version 1.05 to 1.06 (7/11/95)
-------------------------------------------
Fixed bug in "configure" script caused by typo. 
(reported by Adam Jack)

Added support for Attributes=serveall directive allowing the serving
of all files in a directory which are world readable and do not
start with '.' (index and index.cache are excluded).  See
the last section of docs/index_desc.html for more details.

Added documentation for the "Nomatchsub=" directive (formerly called
"Emptysub" but undocumented).  This permits the customization of 
the response to searches which find no matches.  See the last section
of docs/search.html or appendixB.html for more details.

Changed all occurances of "uint" and "uchar" in reg.* to "unsigned"
and "unsigned char" respectively. (suggested by Paul Dubois).

Corrected various typos in documentation.

CHANGES from version 1.04 to 1.05 (7/6/95)
------------------------------------------- 
Added strncasecmp code to wndex/wndex.c which now needs it (only for those
systems which don't have it and have #defined NEED_STRNCASECMP)

Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c which caused it to allow access to IP address
xxx.xxx.xxx.5, for example when only xxx.xxx.xxx.51 was supposed to
have access.

Fixed bug in wn/prequest.c which caused references like 
http://host/~user to fail to be redirected to http://host/~user/
(with final '/' added) as they should be.  Instead they were redirected
to a document relative to the main hierarchy. (Thanks to Stephen White).

Improved the configuration script to handle setting up user homepages.

Replaced the use of "BSD" in config.h and elsewhere with "BSD_LIKE"
in order not to conflict with some systems use of BSD.

CHANGES from version 1.03 to 1.04 (6/5/95)
------------------------------------------- 
Added "conditional included text" for parsed documents.  This allows
you to have public documents contain links to restricted documents 
with the link being invisible unless the client has access to the
restricted document.  But it also does *much* more.  See the files
docs/parse.html and docs/appendixC.html for full details. Do take
a look at this, it is, IMHO, a significant new feature.

Added a new attribute "cgi".  If you add the line 

	Attributes=CGI

to an item in your index file then the standard CGI environment
variables will be set up.  This is useful for filters and for
execed server-side includes.

Fixed bug in wndex/wndex.c that caused mishandling of '&', 
'<', and '>' in the title field of an indexfile.
(Reported by Paul Dubois)

Fixed wn/util.c so that get_local_info doesn't use DNS to overwrite
local hostname specified by #define WN_HOSTNAME in config.h (thanks
to Stephen Trier)

Fixed bug in wn/misc.c in functions strcasecmp() and strncasecmp()
which caused problem on systems which don't have these.

Added timezone to date logfiles and made error logfile have exactly
the same format as the regular logs.

Fixed wn/standalone.c so that an overloaded server doesn't just exit,
but simply discards a request and keeps on going.

Fixed bug in wn/init.c in function logerr which needed to reset date
to the empty string.

Fixed bug in wn/wn.c which caused erroneous HTML to be generated and
served when an error occurs and the senderr() function is called.
(Thanks to Stephen Trier)


CHANGES from version 1.02 to 1.03 (5/7/95)
------------------------------------------- 
Fixed serious bug in wn/chkcntrl.c which caused -e option to fail.

Fixed bug in wn/csearch.c that resulted in a missing <ul> for search
wrapped title, keyword and field searches. 

Fixed bug in wndex which caused mishandling of empty <title> </title>
tag pair.

A request like GET /dir1/dir now generates a redirect to /dir1/dir/
rather than /dir1/dir/index.html.  (Thanks to Christopher Davis)

Fixed bug in wn/cgi.c which caused CGI output headers to be handled
incorrectly if they ended with <CRLF>.  Also fixed bug in wn/wn.c that
caused HTTP header "MIME-version:" not to be sent.  (Thanks to Mike
Gallaher for these fixes).

Fixed bug in send.c which caused it to fail to put WN_KEY into the
environment properly. (Thanks to Mike Gallaher).

Added support for the server attempting RFC931 (aka RFC1413, IDENT, or
TAP) lookups on clients.  This may be good for additional logging
information, but should not be trusted for authentication. (Thanks to
Christopher Davis).  To use this you need to edit the file config.h and 
uncomment the /* #define RFC931_TIMEOUT	(10) */ line.

Added minimal support for different data roots corresponding to different
IP interfaces.  See the section of docs/tilde.html called
"Hierarchies based on IP address."

Added better support for Netscapeisms: Refresh and Cookie/Set-Cookie.
See docs/appendixB.html for more details.  More info about
Cookie/Set-Cookie is in docs/cookie.

CHANGES from version 1.01 to 1.02 (4/9/95)
-------------------------------------------
Fixed bug in wn/prequest.c which caused title and keyword searches from
WN root to fail.

Fixed wndex so it can now handle HTML documents whose titles are not
on a single line.  E.g. 
	<title>
	This is the title
	</title>
can now be used instead of just	<title>This is the title</title>

Fixed bug in wn/wn.c so that CGI scripts never return "304 Not Modified"
but always rerun the script.

Added to security chapter of users' guide.


CHANGES from version 1.00 to 1.01 (3/31/95)
-------------------------------------------
Fixed bug in wndex that caused it to put Keywords in index.cache twice
when they were listed in a <meta> element of and HTML file.

Fixed bug in wndex which caused incorrect default content-type and
created index.html files with missing <ul> when wndex was run with
-r option (thanks to Mike Meyer)

Fixed bug in wn/prequest.c which cause CGI scripts not to work 
when used as DEFAULT_URI.  Also fixed bug that caused /~user/
not to be translated to /~user/index.html and then to /index.html
in directory ~user/public_html/.

Fixed bug in wn/cgi.c that sometimes caused spurious headers on returned
CGI documents.  This showed up most noticeably when doing "server push"
transactions supported by Netscape.

In /wn/util.c added '.' to remotehost name before doing lookup for efficiency.
(thanks to S. Bennett)

Fixed bug in bin/digest which made using first line of records fail
(thanks to Andrew Pam)

CHANGES from version 0.99 to 1.00 (3/13/95)
-------------------------------------------
Added support for /~user URLs and table lookup for root directory
change.  Details are in a new chapter of the users guide (/docs/tilde.html).

Fixed bug in wn/chkcntrl.c which caused access to be granted to 
123.123.123.123 when the accessfile only gave permission to 
123.123.123.12.  It is now necessary when listing an IP subdomain in
an accessfile to end it with a period, e.g. the entry cannot be

	123.123

but must instead be

	123.123.

to grant access to all hosts with IP adresses 123.123.xxx.xxx. Note
that complete IP addresses like 123.123.123.123 must not end with a 
period, however.

Fixed problems in init.c with syslog.  Added new #define LOGPRIORITY
to config.h (thanks to Rob Jenson).

WN_HOSTNAME need no longer be set in config.h.  It has been moved to
the optional items there.  By default it is #defined to be "".  In
this case if the -h option is not used the server will query the
host (if it needs to) to find the name and the port.  Of course if you
want to set it you may, and that value will be used.  The advantage of
the new scheme is a binary compiled once may be used on several hosts
without the -h option.  I should point out the hostname is almost never
used:  it is put in the environment for CGI scripts to consult if they
wish and it is used in certain fairly rare redirections because stupid
browsers don't handle relative URLs in redirections.  (In part this is
thanks to David Capshaw)

If VERBOSELOG is #defined in config.h the the user agent and referrer
are logged.

Changed cgi.c so that CGI scripts now use unbuffered i/o.  This should
work with Netscape's "server push".

CHANGES from version 0.98 to 0.99 (2/20/95)
-------------------------------------------
Fixed bug that caused executable includes to fail.  Also documented
this feature.  (Maybe this wasn't really a bug since the feature had
never been documented.)

Fixed many typos in the documentation (thanks to Paul DuBois) and
updated some sections.

Some security enhancements.


CHANGES from version 0.97 to 0.98 (2/14/95)
-------------------------------------------
Fixed potential security problem involving attack similar to the
famous internet worm fingerd vulnerability.

There is now a #define DEFAULT_URI in the config.h file.  It is set to
"/index.hmtl".  This is the document returned in response to a request
with only the hostname.  You would need to change it if, for example,
you wanted to have the default server response be to run a CGI script.

The default value of TIMEOUT has been reduced to 5 mins, but the timer
is now reset each time 1024 lines of text or 128K of binary data have
been sent.

The DNS name lookup (from the IP address) is now checked more carefully
to help prevent spoofing.  (Thanks to David Capshaw).

The NONET #define is gone and there is now a #define NO_DNS_HOSTNAMES
line in config.h.  Uncommenting this line will mean that there will
be no hostnames in your log file, just IP addresses.  This will reduce
the load on your server (but probably not speed up responses since the
lookups usually take place after the transaction is complete.  Keep in
mind that uncommenting this will mean that none of your CGI scripts will
get the hostname and also that your access files cannot have hostnames
in them, just IP addresses.

CHANGES from version 0.97 to 0.97a (2/8/95)
-------------------------------------------

Fixed bug in authwn.c that caused a segmentation violation if
authwn was run with no arguments.

Removed code to put strerror(errno) in errlog for portability reasons.

CHANGES from version 0.96 to 0.97 (2/7/95)
-------------------------------------------
Removed external declaration of strrchr() from wndex/content.c which
was causing some problems.

Fixed bug in wndex/wndex.c (content-type could sometimes be wrong).

Fixed bug which caused "304 Not modified" transactions not to be logged.

Fixed a couple of places where senderr() had an argument of the wrong
type.

Wndex now removes trailing whitespace from any lines it reads in an
index file.

Errorlog now contains output of strerror(errno).

If WN_ERRORLOGFILE is set to "" and the server is run with the -S option
then error logging will be handled by the syslog facility.

If a CGI script is run and has been authenticated the environment variable
REMOTE_USER is now set to the user name.

When wndex creates an index.html file it now notifies the user of this fact
and moves any existing file of that name to index.html.bak.

Fixed bug in senderr() which caused logging to sometimes omit the URL
and/or file name.

Added function dedot() to prequest.c which replaces "/xxxx/../" and "/./"
in URI path with a single /.

Moved the invocation of get_remote_info() to a point later in the 
serving process.  Now, for most transactions, this will take place
after the document is sent so response time to clients should be faster.

CHANGES from version 0.95 to 0.96 (1/13/95)
-------------------------------------------
Fixed bug in bin/mkpasswd which required a password file to exist 
before working.  (Patch thanks to Ron Pool).

Fixed bug in wndex/wndex.c that caused segmentation violation when
used with the -r option on some systems. (reported by Chael Hall)

Added more to Appendix B in the user's guide.  Also documented 
"line searches" for directories and context and grep searches for files
in search.html.

Fixed bug in file context and grep searches (wn/gsearch.c) which
caused results to be returned as text/plain rather than text/html.


CHANGES from version 0.94 to 0.95 (12/21/94)
-------------------------------------------
Fixed bugs in logging which caused wrong status to be logged for many
transactions and neglected to log username for authenticated transactions.
Changed authwn.c to supply username to wn for logging.

Fixed bug which caused incorrect "Bad field in cache" entries in the
error log.

Applied patch from S. Trier dealing with error returns from a file module.

CHANGES from version 0.93 to 0.94 (12/15/94)
-------------------------------------------
Added support for authentication via module authwn.  See /docs/access.html.

Added support for modules returning failing status.

Fixed bug that allowed searching titles of authenticated directories 
without authentication.

Filters and modules  have a general mechanism for
specifying path:  If 1st char is '/' it's relative to system root,
if it starts with ~/ it's relative to WN root, otherwise it is rel
current directory.  

The -E -e and -u command line flags now affect modules as well as CGI,
filters, etc.

Fixed bug in wndex which caused it sometimes to run out of file descriptors
(some files weren't being closed).

Fixed bug in wndex that caused it sometimes to give two content types
to a single document.

Added support for putting Keywords in HTTP headers and reading them
from <meta...>   lines in HTML documents.

Replaced last half of docs/appendixB.html which somehow got truncated
prior to 0.93.

Corrected documentation on the "digest" utility to indicate the the
proper order of arguments.

Fixed bug in cgi.c which caused environment variable SERVER_PORT not
to be set correctly (reported by A. Damini).

Fixed bug in gsearch.h that caused context searches of filtered files
to fail.

CHANGES from version 0.9 to 0.93 (11/28/94)
-------------------------------------------

Added #define for S_ISLNK(m)  for systems which don't have it.

Added #include <sys/types.h> in prequest.c and chkcntrl.c and removed
#define <sys/stat.h> from wrap.c.

Added utility indexmaker in bin.

Added file mime.types which was missing in the first release.  It is
in /lib

Fixed bug exercised when Netscape uses If-Modified-Since with POST method.

Fixed bug that caused documents requested with If-Modified-Since to be
returned with no Content-type.
