WN version 2.0.6

This file documents the format of an index.cache file for WN.

Parameters in a record of an index file like

	File=foo.html
	Title=This is foo
	Keywords=bar, baz

get translated to a line in the index.cache file like

	file=foo.html&title=This is foo&keywords=bar, baz

i.e. a sequence of token=value pairs separated by ampersands.  Any
ampersands in a value must be escaped with a '\' which will be removed
when the server reads the index.cache file.  All lines in an index.cache
file are terminated with a single '\n' (newline) character. (This is
UNIX after all).

The first line of an index.cache file is the directory record line,
the second line should be blank.  If there is no directory record
line the first line should be blank and file information can start
with the second line.

Here is a list of the elements of an index file and the corresponding
tokens used in the index.cache file.

Directory Record	Cache token
----------------	-----------
Accessfile 		accessfile
Searchwrapper		dwrapper
Nomatchsub		nomatchsub
Subdirs			subdirs
Owner			owner
Cache-module		cachemod	/* Cache data base module */
File-module		filemod		/* File data base  module */
Search-module		indexmod	/* Index search module  module */
Authorization-type	authtype	/* Type of authorization */
Authorization-realm	authrealm	/* Realm for authorization */
Authorization-module	authmod		/* module to do authorization */
Auth-denied-file        authdenied_file 
Default-Content		default_content <see note 1>
Default-Document	default_document
Default-Max-Age		default_maxage  <see note 4>
Attributes		<see note 3>
Default-Attributes	defattributes	<see note 3>
No-such-file-URL	nofile_url
Access-denied-URL	noaccess_url
<none>			cntlfname	<see note 5>

File Record		Cache Token
-----------		-----------
File			file
IndexFile		file
Title			title
URL			url
Header			header		/* HTTP header line added for item */
Parse			parse		/* boolean */
Redirect		redirect
Keywords		keywords
Content-Type		content
Content-Encoding	encoding
Field#			field#			/* e.g. field7 */
Includes		includes
Wrappers		wrappers
Searchwrapper		swrapper
Nomatchsub		nomatchsub
Filter			filter
Expires			expires
Attributes		<see note 2>
Logtype			<see note  >
Set-Cookie		setcookie
Refresh			refresh
Max-Age			maxage  <see note 4>

<Note 1> The Default-content line is used to specify the content-type of
files for which no Content-type record is present.  By default this has
the value "text/plain".

<Note 2> "Attributes=" lines in a file record (or in their absence
"Default-Attributes=" lines in the directory record) get translated
into a numeric value which is the sum of the numbers corresponding
to the items below marked with an (*).  An ASCII representation of
this number prceded by "attributes=" is the item in the index.cache
file.  For example the entry "Attributes=nondynamic, parse, cgi" in
an index file is converted to the entry "attributes=642" (since
642=2+128+512) and "Default-attributes=nondynamic, parse, cgi"  is 
converted to  "defattributes=642".

Items not marked with an (*) should not have their numeric values
added as this is done by the server when it reads e.g. the include
or wrapper line.

dynamic*	(1)
nondynamic*	(2)
include		(4)
wrapped		(8)
swrapped	(16)
filtered	(32)
nosearch*	(64)
parse*		(128)
noparse*	(256)
cgi*		(512)
ismap*		(1024)
nocache		(1<<11)
unbuffered	(1<<12)
cacheable	(1<<13)
nokeepalive	(1<<14)

<Note 3> In the directory record Attributes=nosearch is translated to
nosearch=true and Attributes=serveall is translates to serveall=true.


<Note 4> The maxage and default_maxage lines have the format
"maxage=12345" to indicate 12345 seconds after the document is
served or "maxage=L12345" to indicate 12345 seconds after the 
last modification date of the document.  All times must be converted
to seconds before being put in the index.cache file.

<Note 5> This field is used by wndex to find the name of the "index"
file used in place of the default "index.wn".  It is ignored by the
server.

<Note 6> This field is an Ascii representation of an unsigned integer
whose bits determine the log type according to the following table

	/* Bits in the request logtype */
	WN_NO_LOG		(1<<0)
	WN_COMMON_LOG		(1<<1)
	WN_VERBOSE_LOG		(1<<2)
	WN_NCSA_LOG		(1<<3)
	WN_LOG_SYSLOG		(1<<4)
	WN_VERBOSE_SYSLOG	(1<<5)
	NO_DNS_LOG		(1<<11)
	REV_DNS_LOG		(1<<12)
