    <h3>2.1 <a name="installing">Installing the Software</a></h3>

    <p>
      Get the source file from <a
      href="http://hopf.math.northwestern.edu/">http://hopf.math.northwestern.edu/</a>
      (U.S.) or <a
      href="http://www.wnserver.org/">http://www.wnserver.org/</a>
      (Europe) then uncompress it and untar it to make the
      <em>WN</em> source directory hierarchy.  The file must be uncompressed
      with the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> compression utility <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man1/gzip.1.gz"><code>gzip(1)</code></a>
      (or <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man1/gunzip.1.gz"><code>gunzip(1)</code></a>).
      The resulting file <code>wn.tar</code> should be unpacked with the UNIX
      <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man1/tar.1.gz"><code>tar(1)</code></a>
      utility using "<code>tar&nbsp;-xvf&nbsp;wn.tar</code>".  The top level of
      the directory created by untarring this file contains several
      directories, including: <code>wn</code>, <code>wndex</code>,
      <code>wnauth</code> and <code>docs</code>.
    </p>


    <h4>2.1.1 <a name="installing.configure">Configuring <em>WN</em></a></h4>

    <p>
      If your system supports <a href="http://www.perl.org/">perl</a>, the
      quickest way to get your server configured is to run the <a
      href="http://www.perl.org/">perl</a> program "<code>configure</code>"
      which is in the main source directory.  Do this with the command:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        perl configure
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This program will ask you various questions, like what version of UNIX
      you are using and the path to the directory you want to be the
      <code>wnroot</code> of your data hierarchy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Default answers are printed in square brackets <code>[&nbsp;]</code> so
      you can simply press return to enter that value.  You can quit at any
      time by pressing <code>Ctrl-C</code> and nothing should be changed.  If
      you want to try it once to see what the questions are, that is fine.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program creates two files: <a
      href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> and
      <code>Makefile</code> which are customized based on the answers you gave.
      You may rerun this program as many times as you like.  The first time you
      run the program the default values are those in the file <a
      href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h.dist</code></a>.  Subsequent
      times the default values for all question answers are taken from the most
      recent <a href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> you have
      produced (if it still exists in the top level directory).
    </p>

    <p>
      An alternative to running this program is to copy the files
      <code>Makefile.dist</code> and <a
      href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h.dist</code></a> to
      <code>Makefile</code> and <a
      href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> respectively and edit
      them manually.  If you want to use some of the features which are not
      turned on by default like multiple IP interfaces, you will have to edit
      at least <a href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a>.  I
      recommend starting with the <a href="http://www.perl.org/">perl</a>
      program and getting your server up and running.  Then you can go back
      browse through <a href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> to
      see if there are things you want to change.  If there are you will have
      to recompile but that takes only a few minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are some of the questions you will be asked when you run
      <code>configure</code>.  You will be given a list of supported operating
      systems and asked to pick the one you are using, e.g. <code>SUNOS</code>,
      <code>SOLARIS2</code>, <code>AIX</code>, <code>LINUX</code>, etc.  You
      will be asked the complete path name of your data directory.  You will
      also have to enter the names of the <a href="#logging">access and error
      log files</a> you wish to use (they can be the same file).  If you don't
      want logging or you want to use the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man8/syslogd.8.gz"><code>syslogd(8)</code></a>
      system utility (i.e. the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#S_opt"><code>-S</code></a> option) then these
      should both be defined to be the empty string (i.e. a pair of double
      quotes with nothing between them like <code>""</code>).  If you specify
      the names of these log files then you must make sure that either these
      two files exist and are writable by the server or that they are files in
      a directory where the server has permission to create them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additional customizations in <a
      href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> are possible but
      should not be needed.  These customizations require that you manually
      edit the <a href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> file.  For
      example, there is a <a
      href="configmacros.html#DEFAULT_URI"><code>#define&nbsp;DEFAULT_URI</code></a>
      line in the <a href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> file.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may also customize the file <code>Makefile</code> in the top level
      directory.  In particular you should do this if you wish to specify a C
      compiler other than the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man1/gcc.1.gz"><code>cc(1)</code></a>
      utility (e.g. <a href="http://www.fsf.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">gcc</a>)
      should be used for compiling.  Also some systems require that special
      libraries for sockets, or whatever, be mentioned in the compile command.
      The configuration program attempts to do this, but I am working from user
      reports since I do not have access to most of the UNIX variations.  If
      they are incorrect please let <a href="mailto:john@math.northwestern.edu">me</a>
      know.
    </p>


    <h4>2.1.2 <a name="installing.build">Building <em>WN</em></a></h4>

    <p>
      In the top level directory do a <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man1/make.1.gz"><code>make(1)</code></a>
      to produce the server <code>wnd</code>, the stand-alone version
      <code>wnsd</code> and the utility <a href="utility.html#wndex">wndex</a>.
      This utility is used to produce <code>index.cache</code> files for use by
      the server.  If the <code>make</code> proceeds without problem you should
      next do a "<code>make&nbsp;install</code>".  This will strip the binaries
      and place them in the top level <code>bin</code> directory or whatever
      directory you specified when you ran the <a
      href="#installing.configure"><code>configure</code></a> program.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you specified a log file name or error log file name when you ran the
      configuration program or edited <a
      href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> you will need to make
      sure that these files exist and that they are writable by the user id
      under which the server will run.  The best way to do this is create the
      files as <code>root</code> ("<code>touch&nbsp;wn.log</code>"), then
      change their ownership to the appropriate user
      ("<code>chown&nbsp;nobody&nbsp;wn.log</code>") and finally set the
      permissions appropriately ("<code>chmod&nbsp;644&nbsp;wn.log</code>").
      An alternative is to create a directory in which these files will reside
      and make sure that the user <code>nobody</code> has permission to create
      files in this directory.  Then the server will create the files with
      proper ownership and permissions.
    </p>



    <h3>2.2 <a name="stand-alone">Running the Server as a Stand-alone
    Daemon</a></h3>

    <p>
      You can now either run the server as a stand-alone daemon, the
      <code>wnsd</code> executable, or run under the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man8/inetd.8.gz"><code>inetd(8)</code></a>
      system utility, the <code>wnd</code> executable.  We first describe the
      stand-alone version.  Run this with the command:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
	wnsd -p port [other options] wnroot
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      where "<code>port</code>" is the number of the port on which you wish the
      server to run.  If this is a non-privileged port (i.e. &gt; 1024) then
      <code>wnsd</code> can be run as an ordinary user.  However, for
      privileged ports like 80 you must run the command above as
      <code>root</code>.  If <code>wnsd</code> is run without the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#p_opt"><code>-p</code></a> option it will use port
      80 by default.  If <code>wnsd</code> is run by <code>root</code> then
      when it starts up it will change its user id to the one set when running
      the configuration program or by editing the <a
      href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> file line containing
      <a href="configmacros.html#USERID"><code>#define&nbsp;USERID</code></a>.
      Otherwise it will have all the permissions of the user who runs it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The safest practice is to use the numeric UID of <code>nobody</code> for
      the <a href="configmacros.html#USERID"><code>USERID</code></a> set in <a
      href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> (this is the default)
      and then start the server as <code>root</code>.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>Note:</em> on HPUX and
      perhaps other systems user <code>nobody</code> cannot be used.  In this
      case just create a new user, say "<code>www</code>", with the fewest
      possible privileges and no shell.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The server needs to have <code>root</code> permissions to connect to a
      socket on a privileged port and listen for requests.  But immediately
      after doing so it will change its user id to that of <code>nobody</code>
      and have minimal access permissions.  In this situation the user
      <code>nobody</code> needs to have only read permission to your server
      data and should not own or have have write permission.  In particular
      <code>nobody</code> should not have ownership or write access of the
      <code>index.cache</code> database file described in the chapter "<a
      href="index_desc.html">Creating Your <em>WN</em> Data Hierarchy</a>" of
      this guide.
    </p>



    <h3>2.3 <a name="inetd">Running the Server Under
    <code>inetd(8)</code></a></h3>

    <p>
      The other way to run the server is to use it under the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man8/inetd.8.gz"><code>inetd(8)</code></a>
      system utility. This is an efficient way to run the server if the load on
      it is relatively light (a few thousand hits per day) and the host on
      which it runs is used for other purposes.  There are variations on how
      <code>inetd(8)</code> works from system to system so you may need to look
      at the man page for the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man8/inetd.8.gz"><code>inetd.conf(5)</code></a>
      configuration file.  Here's how it works under many systems (e.g. SunOS
      4.1.3): Edit the file UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man5/services.5.gz"><code>services(5)</code></a>
      configuration file and create the line:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        wnd  80/tcp
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      or replacing <code>80</code> by the port you wish to use.  Then edit the
      file <code>inetd.conf(5)</code> and insert the line:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        wnd    stream    tcp nowait    nobody    /path/wnd    wnd
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      After the last <code>wnd</code> you can have optional arguments to turn
      on logging or use a different data directory.  Some <code>inetd(8)</code>
      limit the number of arguments you may use so I prefer to use a small
      program in place of <code>wnd</code> here.  My <code>inetd.conf(5)</code>
      line looks like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        wnd    stream    tcp nowait    nobody    /path/wn.rc    wn.rc
      </code>
    </blockquote> 

    <p>
      and <code>wn.rc</code> contains only the two lines:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        #!/bin/sh
        <br>
        exec /path/wnd -t 202 -L /path2/logfile wnroot
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      It is important to run <code>wnd</code> as <code>nobody</code> (the fifth
      field in the <code>inetd.conf(5)</code> line above) or some other user
      with no special access privileges.  If you are using an
      <code>inetd(8)</code> with without the capability to set UID on startup
      (e.g., Ultrix), you should define the group ID and user ID in <a
      href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> so that the program is
      not running as <code>root</code> (look for the <a
      href="configmacros.html#USERID"><code>#define&nbsp;USERID</code></a> and
      <a href="configmacros.html#GROUPID"><code>#define&nbsp;GROUPID</code></a>
      and set the values appropriately).  It should <strong>never</strong> be
      necessary to run <code>wnd</code> under <code>inetd(8)</code> as
      <code>root</code> and to do so would be a serious mistake for maintaining
      security.  Every attempt has been made to make <code>wnd</code> as secure
      as possible, even if it is run as <code>root</code>, however, no program
      accessible to remote users on the Internet can be assumed perfectly
      secure. See the chapter "<a href="security.html">Security on the
      <em>WN</em> Server</a>" in this guide.
    </p>

    <p>
      After editing the <code>inetd.conf(5)</code> and <code>services(5)</code>
      files you should find the process id number of the <code>inetd(8)</code>
      process and use the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man1/kill.1.gz"><code>kill(1)</code></a>
      utility to reload the configuration using
      "<code>kill&nbsp;-HUP&nbsp;&lt;process_id&gt;</code>".  This must be done
      as <code>root</code>.  You find the number
      "<code>&lt;process_id&gt;</code>" by using the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man1/ps.1.gz"><code>ps(1)</code></a>
      utility or by looking at the contents of the file (which you specified
      when you ran the <a
      href="#installing.configure"><code>configure</code></a> program) in which
      the server stores this number.
    </p>



    <h3>2.4 <a name="hostname">Your Hostname: What's in a Name?</a></h3>

    <p>
      If the fully qualified domain name of your server is <code>abc.com</code>
      you might like to have your server known as <code>www.abc.com</code> or
      some other "vanity" name.  For most purposes this is simply a matter of
      properly setting up <a href="http://www.dns.net/dnsrd/">Domain Name
      Service</a> (DNS) on your system so that the system responds to the
      desired name.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>Note:</em> To use multiple vanity names for different IP addresses on
      a single server see the chapter "<a href="multi.html">Multi-homed or
      Virtual Servers on the <em>WN</em> Server</a>" in this guide.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      There are a few instances, however, where the <em>WN</em> server does use
      its own hostname.  Ideally, in my opinion, the server should do nothing
      with its hostname and not even need to know it.  This is not possible for
      two reasons.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, the <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1
      protocol</a> requires the server to pass its hostname to CGI programs in
      an environmental variable whenever those programs are run.  Secondly
      clients often implement redirection so that it cannot handle relative but
      only complete <a
      href="http://linux-howto.com/rfc/rfc1500-1999/rfc1738.txt">URLs</a>.
      (This is a mistake in my view, but one we have to live with.)  Thus when
      a server redirects to another local document it must supply its own
      hostname.  These are the only places <em>WN</em> uses hostname.
    </p>

    <p>
      For most cases then, <em>WN</em> only uses it hostname when a redirection
      is done.  This happens in several circumstances.  The most common is when
      a request is made for a directory any the trailing '<code>/</code>' is
      left off of the <a
      href="http://linux-howto.com/rfc/rfc1500-1999/rfc1738.txt">URL</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      So how does <em>WN</em> know its hostname?  When you run the <a
      href="#installing.configure"><code>configure</code></a> program you are
      queried for the value you want or you have the option of using a system
      call at the time the server is run.  This value is placed into the <a
      href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> header file and
      compiled into your server.  In the file <a
      href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> the <a
      href="configmacros.html#WN_HOSTNAME"><code>#define&nbsp;WN_HOSTNAME</code></a>
      macro is set by default to the empty string.  If this is not changed the
      server will get its name from the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man3/gethostbyaddr.3.gz"><code>gethostbyaddr(3)</code></a>
      system call.  If this is set to another string that string will be used.
      If you are using <em>WN</em> as a multi-homed server then you need to set
      different names for the different IP addresses.  This is done in the file
      <code>wn/vhost.h</code> which you edit to set up the correspondence
      between IP addresses and <code>wnroot</code> directories.
    </p>



    <h3>2.5 <a name="testing">Testing Your Setup</a></h3>

    <p>
      After compiling and setting up the software you can test it on a sample
      directory provided with the distribution.  To do this first make a
      symbolic link in your <code>wnroot</code> data directory to the
      <code>docs</code> directory in the source distribution.  The command
      "<code>ln&nbsp;-s&nbsp;/your/src/dir/docs&nbsp;docs</code>" executed in
      the <code>wnroot</code> directory should do this.  If your system does
      not support symbolic links you can copy this directory and its
      subdirectories to your data directory temporarily.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now you are ready to test your server installation on this directory.
      Try it with your favorite HTTP client. The <a
      href="http://linux-howto.com/rfc/rfc1500-1999/rfc1738.txt">URL</a> should
      be:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        http://localhost/docs/index.html
      </code>
    </blockquote>



    <h3>2.6 <a name="shutdown">Shutting Down Your Server</a></h3>

    <p>
      If your are running under UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man8/inetd.8.gz"><code>inetd(8)</code></a>
      system utility as <a href="#inetd">described above</a> then to shut down
      the server first remove or comment out the line you created in the UNIX
      <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man8/inetd.8.gz"><code>inetd.conf(5)</code></a>
      configuration file.  Then you should again find the process id number of
      the <code>inetd(8)</code> process and run the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man1/kill.1.gz"><code>kill(1)</code></a>
      utility using "<code>kill&nbsp;-HUP&nbsp;&lt;process_id&gt;</code>" where
      "<code>&lt;process_id&gt;</code>" is the process id number of
      <code>inetd(8)</code> just as you did to start <em>WN</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are running <code>wnsd</code>, the stand-alone version of
      <em>WN</em>, you should find the process id number of the running
      <code>wnsd</code> by using the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man1/ps.1.gz"><code>ps(1)</code></a>
      utility or by looking at the contents of the file (which you specified
      when you ran the <a
      href="#installing.configure"><code>configure</code></a> program or by
      using the <a href="appendixA1.html#q_opt"><code>-q</code></a> option) in
      which the server stores this number.  Then you run the UNIX
      <code>kill(1)</code> utility using
      "<code>kill&nbsp;&lt;process_id&gt;</code>" where
      "<code>&lt;process_id&gt;</code>" is the process id number of
      <code>wnsd</code>.  If you started the server as <code>root</code> you
      should be <code>root</code> to kill it.
    </p>



    <h3>2.7 <a name="logging">Managing Log Files</a></h3>

    <p>
      There are two ways to log <em>WN</em> transactions: dedicated log files
      or using the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man8/syslogd.8.gz"><code>syslogd(8)</code></a>
      system utility.  We first describe dedicated log files.
    </p>

    <p>
      Normally when you use <em>WN</em> you will keep two log files.  The first
      is a log of all "normal" transactions and the second records error
      conditions or items which might require your attention.  For example, if
      the server cannot find a file which your <code>index.wn</code> file
      indicates should be served it will log an error.  The error log file can
      be the same file used for the normal transaction log.  In general the
      difference between the two is that the error log gets information about
      anything which might require attention of the maintainer while routine
      transactions and errors which are simply user errors tend to go to the
      regular log.  The intent is that a conscientious maintainer should keep
      an eye on the error log but need not read the (much larger) log of
      regular transactions.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two ways to tell the server the names of these files.  The
      first is by supplying the file names when you run the <a
      href="#installing.configure"><code>configure</code></a> program and then
      compiling these into your server.  And the second is by supplying the
      file names on the command line when you execute the server.  This is done
      with the <a href="appendixA1.html#L_opt"><code>-L</code></a> option and
      the <a href="appendixA1.html#l_opt"><code>-l</code></a> option to specify
      the transaction and error log files respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, executing the command:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        wnsd -L /path2/logfile -l /path3/error.log wnroot
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      will cause the server to use "<code>logfile</code>" and
      "<code>error.log</code>" as the log file and error log respectively.  Of
      course, it is necessary for the server to have write permission to these
      files and execute permission on the directory containing them.
    </p>

    <p>
      A good way to achieve this if the server is running as
      <code>nobody</code> is to create the files yourself and change their
      ownership to the user <code>nobody</code>.  This can be done, for
      example, with the commands:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        touch&nbsp;logfile
        <br>
        /usr/etc/chown&nbsp;nobody&nbsp;logfile
        <br>
        chmod&nbsp;600&nbsp;logfile
        <br>
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      executed as <code>root</code> in the directory where the log file is to
      reside.  The first of these commands creates the file
      "<code>logfile</code>".  The second makes <code>nobody</code> the owner
      and the third gives <code>nobody</code> (and no one else except
      <code>root</code>) permission to read and write this file.  You might
      want to allow others to read, but not write to the log file, or security
      of the log file might not be a concern.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus a program executed by the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man8/crond.8.gz"><code>crond(8)</code></a>
      system utility to rotate log files might look like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        cd /path2
        <br>
        mv logfile logfile.old
        <br>
        touch logfile
        <br>
        chown nobody logfile
        <br>
        chmod 600 logfile
        <br>
        kill -HUP `/bin/cat /path/to/wn.pid`
        <br>
        chown maintainer logfile.old
        <br>
        chmod 600 logfile.old
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      where <code>/path/to/wn.pid</code> is a file containing the processes id
      of the server created by using the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#q_opt"><code>-q</code></a> option or by specifying
      this filename when the <a
      href="#installing.configure"><code>configure</code></a> program is run.
      If neither of these has been done the stand-alone server,
      <code>wnsd</code>, will print its process id on the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man3/stdio.3.gz"><code>stdout(3)</code></a>
      stream when it is run.  If you are using <code>wnd</code> under <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man8/inetd.8.gz"><code>inetd(8)</code></a>
      there is no need to send the <code>-HUP</code> signal as the server must
      close this file after each transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using a system that supports the <code>logrotate</code>
      program, it provides a good way to handle logs.  Here is an excerpt
      from a typical logrotate.conf file.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <code>
	/var/log/wnsd/error_log {
        <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daily
        <br>
	}
        <br>

	/var/log/wnsd/access_log {
        <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daily
        <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;postrotate
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/bin/killall -HUP wnsd
        <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endscript
        <br>
	}
        <br>
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This causes the logs to be rotated daily.  The command
      <code>/usr/bin/killall -HUP wnsd</code> assumes that your
      system supports the <code>killall</code> command, in which
      case it finds the process id of the wnsd process and sends it
      the -HUP signal, as was done by the <code>kill</code> command.
      in the script above.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are three formats which the server can use in writing its
      log files, each with three options concerning how much DNS
      lookup to do for the remote host.  The two most common formats
      are "verbose" and "common log format".  The verbose mode is
      essentially the common log format but with the user-agent,
      referrer, HTTP cookie, and virtual server nickname appended to
      the line for that transaction as well as better transaction
      error messages if necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can chose between verbose and common log formats by answering the
      relevant question when running the <a
      href="#installing.configure"><code>configure</code></a> program before
      compilation (or by editing <a
      href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      To use the third format you need to use the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#v_opt"><code>-v</code></a> command line
      option.  When the server is invoked with the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#v_opt"><code>-v</code></a> option it will
      write a log file in the format specified by the value of this
      option.  The legal values for this option are
      "<code>common</code>", "<code>verbose</code>", and
      "<code>ncsa</code>".  They cause the log file to be written in
      the so-called common log format, or <em>WN</em>'s verbose format
      including user agent, referrer, X-Forwarded-For header, virtual
      server nickname, and cookies, or in the NCSA extended format
      which includes just referrer and user agent.  When using verbose
      logging the nickname (enclosed in angle brackets) will be the
      last field of each log entry.  If virtual hosting is not being used
      this field will be omitted.
    </p>

    <p>
      More precisely a verbose log line begins with a normal "common" log
      format line and then adds the following:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;(pid/count) msg1: msg2&gt; &lt;user_agent&gt; &lt;referrer&gt; &lt;cookie&gt; &lt;X-forwarded-for&gt; &lt;nickname&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The punctuation characters, i.e., <code>&lt; &gt; ( )</code> and
      <code>:</code>, will always be present in this order.  The
      fields "<code>msg1</code>" and "<code>msg2</code>" may contain
      additional parentheses or colons.  Hopefully none of the fields
      will contain the character '<code>&lt;</code>' or the character
      '<code>&gt;</code>', but "referrer", "cookie", "X-forwarded-for"
      and "nickname" are provided by the browser or the server
      maintainer so <em>WN</em> has no control over them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fields are as follows:
    </p>

    <center>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>field</th>
          <th>description</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>pid</td>
          <td>Process id of the process serving the transaction.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>count</td>
          <td>
            n if this is the nth transaction of this (keepalive) connection.
          </td> 
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>msg1</td>
          <td>Description of transaction. May be sent to user.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>msg2</td>
          <td>
            Description of transaction. Information <em>NOT</em> sent to user.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>user_agent</td>
          <td>From the HTTP user agent header.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>referrer</td>
          <td>From the HTTP referer (sic) header.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>cookie</td>
          <td>From the client's cookie header.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>X-forwarded-for</td>
          <td>From the client's X-Forwarded-For header.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>nickname</td>
          <td>Value assigned this virtual host by the maintainer (omitted if virtual 
           hosting is not used).</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </center>

    <p>
      The NCSA format will likely only be of interest if you want to use log
      processing tools which expect this format.  If the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#v_opt"><code>-v</code></a> option option is not
      specified the server will default to either the common log format or the
      <em>WN</em> verbose format depending on which was selected when the <a
      href="#installing.configure"><code>configure</code></a> program was run.
      The utility <a href="utility.html#wnv2c"><code>wnv2c</code></a> can
      convert verbose log files to log files in the shorter common log format.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <em>WN</em> server does not send the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man3/stdio.3.gz"><code>stderr(3)</code></a>
      stream output to the error log file, but leaves its default the terminal
      from which the server is invoked.  This allows the maintainer to set it
      to a file of her choice, for example the error log, or leave it directed
      to the console window in which <code>wnsd</code> was invoked.  To
      redirect it to a file called <code>my.errs</code> simply run
      <code>wnsd</code> with a command like
      "<code>wnsd&nbsp;&lt;options&gt;&nbsp;2&gt;my.errs</code>" if you are
      using a Borne-like shell like <code>sh(1)</code>.  The server itself
      sends very few things to <code>stderr(3)</code> -- only errors which it
      is impossible to put in the error log (like "Can't open error log file").
      The real usefulness of redirecting <code>stderr(3)</code> comes when you
      are creating <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1
      programs</a> because their errors are typically sent to
      <code>stderr(3)</code> so you can easily view them rather than have them
      buried in a log file.
    </p>



    <h3>2.8 <a name="trouble">Trouble Shooting</a></h3>

    <p>
      If things are not working as they should here are some tips to help you
      isolate the problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the compilation was successful you can check the server itself by
      executing it from the command line.  If you use the command:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        wnd  wnroot
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      it should run and pause for input.  Type the line:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        GET /&lt;ret&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      and in response <code>wnd</code> should print the raw HTML of the
      <code>index.html</code> file in your top level directory (perhaps along
      with a message about not being able to open a log file).  If instead you
      type:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        GET /docs/overview.html&lt;ret&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      (and you still have the <code>/docs</code> subdirectory in your top level
      directory) the overview document should be sent to your screen.  If this
      doesn't happen there should be an error message which may be helpful.
      Better error messages are placed in the log file so you may want run
      <code>wnd</code> again with the additional arguments
      "<code>-L&nbsp;logfile</code>" and then examine the contents of the log
      file.  Or if you run "<code>wnd&nbsp;-L&nbsp;/dev/tty</code>" the log
      entries will be printed to your screen instead of being put in a file. If
      the server can't open a file, for example, the name of that file will be
      recorded in the log file. Check its permissions. Remember that all files
      that <code>wnd</code> serves must be world readable.  More serious errors
      are put in a separate error log.  So you might want to try the command
      "<code>wnd&nbsp;-L&nbsp;file&nbsp;-l&nbsp;file2</code>" and then type the
      <code>GET</code> requests described above.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this succeeds you should run the server for real, either under <a
      href="#inetd"><code>inetd(8)</code></a> or <a
      href="#stand-alone">stand-alone</a>.  In order to use port 80 the server
      must be started by <code>root</code>.  It will then switch to user
      <code>nobody</code>.  It does this immediately after connecting to port
      80, before it does anything else including opening its log file.  If you
      get a message that the server cannot open its log file then either you
      have specified putting the log file in a directory where user
      <code>nobody</code> does not have permission to create files or you have
      specified an existing file which the server does not have permission to
      write.
    </p>

    <p>
      After starting the server a useful test is to use the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man1/telnet.1.gz"><code>telnet(1)</code></a>
      utility to connect to your server at port on which you are running.  You
      should get a connection message and a pause for input.  If you get a
      "<code>Connection refused</code>" message and you are running under
      <code>inetd(8)</code>, it is likely there is a problem with your
      <code>inetd(8)</code> setup or for some reason your system can't find or
      can't execute the <code>wnd</code> binary.  If you are using
      <code>wnsd</code> this message means that <code>wnsd</code> is not in
      fact running.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you still have problems feel free to ask questions on the <a
      href="http://hopf.math.northwestern.edu/listserv.html"><em>WN</em> list
      server</a>.  There are many helpful people there.  But it is a good idea
      to try the steps above first and to include the relevant log file
      messages with your request.
