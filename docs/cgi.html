    <h2 align="center">Using CGI Programs on the <em>WN</em> Server</h2>
    <hr size="4">

    <p>
      CGI stands for <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">Common Gateway
      Interface</a>.  It provides a standard for Web servers to interact with
      programs which are not part of the server but may produce output which
      you wish to serve.
    </p>


    <h3>16.1 <a name="need">Do You Need a CGI Program?</a></h3>

    <p>
      Many functions which are done by CGI programs on other servers are built
      in features of <em>WN</em>.  If your needs can be met by these features
      then not only will you save yourself considerable effort in creating,
      setting up, and maintaining programs, but the built in
      feature will perform much more efficiently and much more securely than a
      CGI program.
    </p>

    <p>
      These features include the ability to respond with different text or
      entirely different documents based on the the client request, the
      client's hostname, IP address, user-agent, or the "referer", the document
      containing the link.  For information about this see the chapter "<a
      href="parse.html#if">Parsed Text and Server Side Includes on the
      <em>WN</em> Server</a>" in this guide.  Also support for "imagemaps" or
      clickable images is built in so there is no need to use CGI for this.
      See the chapter "<a href="click.html">Clickable Images and Imagemap files
      on the <em>WN</em> Server</a>" in this guide.  Finally <em>WN</em>
      supports a variety of methods of searching your data including by title,
      keyword, or full text.  See the chapter "<a href="search.html">Setting Up
      Searches on the <em>WN</em> Server</a>" in this guide.
    </p>

    <p>
      If these features do not meet your needs and something like a CGI program
      will, then you may wish to consider using a <a
      href="filter.html#cgi"><em>WN</em> filter</a>. These have most of the
      functionality of CGI programs, but are somewhat more secure and have one
      advantage: the output of filters can be <a href="parse.html">parsed</a>
      while CGI output cannot.
    </p>


    <h3>16.2 <a name="recognize">How Does the Server Recognize a CGI
    Program?</a></h3>

    <p>
      It would be nice if one could simply indicate in the appropriate <a
      href="index_desc.html#index"><code>index.wn</code></a> file that a
      particular file is a CGI program which should be executed rather than
      served.  Unfortunately, the CGI protocol makes it impossible to implement
      this in an efficient way.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two mechanisms in fairly common use with other servers for
      indicating that a file is a CGI program and <em>WN</em> supports them
      both.  The first is to give the file name a special extension (by default
      it is "<code>.cgi</code>") which indicates that it is a CGI program.
      Thus any file you serve with the name "<code>something.cgi</code>" will
      be treated as a CGI program.  The special extension "<code>.cgi</code>"
      can be changed by redefining the macro "<a
      href="configmacros.html#CGI_EXT"><code>#define&nbsp;CGI_EXT</code></a>" by
      editing the file <a href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a>
      and recompiling servers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second mechanism is to have specially named directories with the
      property that any file in that directory will be assumed to be a CGI
      program.  The default for this special name is "<code>cgi-bin</code>".
      Thus, if you have a directory <code>/cgi-bin</code> in your hierarchy the
      server will assume that any file served from that directory is a CGI
      program.  Of course, as always, only files listed in that directory's <a
      href="index_desc.html#index"><code>index.wn</code></a> file will be
      servable.  No files in subdirectories of <code>/cgi-bin</code> can be
      served.  This is because the server will alway interpret a request for
      "<code>/cgi-bin/foo/bar</code>" as meaning run the program
      "<code>/cgi-bin/foo</code>" with the <a
      href="appendixD.html#cgi.PATH_INFO"><code>PATH_INFO</code></a> CGI
      environment variable set to "<code>bar</code>".  Thus if
      "<code>foo</code>" is actually a directory and "<code>bar</code>" a file
      in it, the request will fail.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no need for <code>/cgi-bin</code> to be at the top of your
      hierarchy.  It could be anywhere in the hierarchy.  And, in fact, you can
      have as many directories named "<code>cgi-bin</code>" as you like.  They
      will all be treated the same.  The special name "<code>cgi-bin</code>"
      can be changed by redefining the macro "<a
      href="configmacros.html#CGI_EXT"><code>#define&nbsp;CGI_BIN</code></a>"
      by editing the file <a href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a>
      and recompiling servers.
    </p>


    <h3>16.3 <a name="design">How Does a CGI Program Work?</a></h3>

    <p>
      It is beyond the scope of this document to provide an extensive tutorial
      in writing CGI programs.  There is an online tutorial at <a
      href="http://WDVL.internet.com/Tutorial/CGI/">WDVL.internet.com</a> and
      another available from <a
      href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/overview.html">NCSA</a>. A
      collection of links to CGI information is available at <a
      href="http://www.stars.com/Vlib/Providers/CGI.html">www.stars.com</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will provide only a simple example of a CGI program written in <a
      href="http://www.perl.org/">perl</a>.  More examples can be found in the
      <code>/docs/examples</code> directory of the <em>WN</em> distribution.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        #!/usr/local/bin/perl
        <br>
        # Simple example of CGI program.
        <br>
        <br>
        print "Content-type: text/html\r\n";
        <br>
        # The first line must specify content type.  Other
        <br>
        # optional headers might go here.
        <br>
        <br>
        print "\r\n";
        <br>
        # A blank line ends the headers.  All header lines should
        <br>
        # end with CRLF ("\r\n"), but other lines don't need to.
        <br>
        <br>
        # From now on everything goes to the client
        <br>
        <br>
        print "&lt;body&gt;\n";
        <br>
        print "&lt;h2&gt;A few CGI environment variables:&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n";
        <br>
        <br>
        print "REMOTE_HOST = $ENV{REMOTE_HOST}&lt;br&gt;\n";
        <br>
        print "HTTP_REFERER = $ENV{HTTP_REFERER}&lt;br&gt;\n";
        <br>
        print "HTTP_USER_AGENT = $ENV{HTTP_USER_AGENT}&lt;br&gt;\n";
        <br>
        print "QUERY_STRING = $ENV{QUERY_STRING}&lt;br&gt;\n";
        <br>
        print "&lt;p&gt;\n";
        <br>
        <br>
        print "&lt;/body&gt;\n";
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Notice that the first thing the program does is provide the <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/Protocols/">HTTP/1.1</a>
      "<code>Content-type:</code>" header line.  It may be followed by other
      optional headers you want the server to send.  The end of these headers
      is indicated by a blank line.  Of course the server will add additional
      headers.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default the <em>WN</em> server assumes that the output of any CGI
      program is "dynamic" or different each time the program is run and is
      also "non-cachable".  Hence the server behaves as if the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.attributes">Attributes=</a>dynamic,non-cachable</code>"
      directive had been used.  The "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.attributes.dynamic">Attributes=dynamic</a></code>"
      causes the server not to send a last modified date or a content length
      since they might be constantly changing.  The "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.attributes.non-cachable">Attributes=non-cachable</a></code>"
      attempts to dissuade clients and proxies from caching the output by
      sending an appropriate HTTP header.
    </p>

    <p>
      If, in fact, the output of your program is always the same, you can use
      the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.attributes.nondynamic">Attributes=nondynamic</a></code>"
      directive.  Also if you wish it to be cached you must use the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.attributes.cachable">Attributes=cachable</a></code>"
      directive.  In particular, if you want the browser "back" button to
      return users to a a CGI generated page after they have followed a link
      you may need "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.attributes.cachable">Attributes=cachable</a></code>"
      (especially with an HTML "<a
      href="http://htmlhelp.com/reference/wilbur/block/form.html"><code>&lt;form&nbsp;action="post"&gt;</code></a>")
      since otherwise the browser may not even cache the page in memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program above is a good example of one which should not be cached as
      it prints out the client's hostname, user agent and the URL of the
      document which contains the link to this CGI program.  The CGI program
      gets this information about the client from environmental variables set
      by the server.  A complete list of the standard CGI environment variables
      and a description of what they contain plus a description of some
      additional non-standard ones supplied by the <em>WN</em> server can be
      found in the appendix "<a href="appendixD.html">CGI and Other Environment
      Variables on the <em>WN</em> server</a>" in this guide.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to setting these environment variables appropriately the
      server will change the current working directory of the CGI process to
      the directory in which the CGI program is located.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>Note:</em> In general a CGI program has complete control over its
      output, so it is responsible for doing things which the server might do
      for a static document.  This means that you cannot use many of the
      <em>WN</em> features with CGI output.  In particular the server will not
      use a filter or parse it for
      "<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#include&nbsp;--&gt;</code>", etc.  The CGI program
      must do these things for itself.  Also the server will not provide ranges
      specified in the "<code>Range:</code>" header.  Instead the contents of
      this header is passed to the program in the environment variable <a
      href="appendixD.html#cgi.HTTP_RANGE"><code>HTTP_RANGE</code></a>, so the
      program can do the range processing.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      One thing you should be aware of in writing programs is that the
      <em>WN</em> server does not send the UNIX <code>stderr(3)</code> stream
      to the <a href="setup.html#logging">error log file</a>, but leaves its
      default the terminal from which the server is invoked.  This allows the
      maintainer to set it to a file of her choice or leave it directed to the
      console window in which <code>wnsd</code> was invoked.  To redirect it to
      a file called "<code>my.errs</code>" simply run <code>wnsd</code> with a
      command like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        wnsd&nbsp;&lt;options&gt;&nbsp;2&gt;my.errs
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      if you are using a UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man1/sh.1.gz">sh(1)</a> Borne-like
      shell.  This can be useful when debugging CGI programs because their
      errors are typically sent to the UNIX <code>stderr(3)</code> stream so
      you can easily view them with the UNIX <a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man1/tail.1.gz"><code>tail(1)</code></a>
      utility like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        tail&nbsp;-f&nbsp;my.errs
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      rather than have them buried in a log file.
    </p>


    <h3>16.4 <a name="handlers">CGI Handlers</a></h3>

    <p>
      Sometimes you may have a number of files which are to be processed by the
      same CGI program or program.  In that case you might consider designating
      a "handler" for these files instead of putting the the name of the CGI
      program in the URL for each of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The file directive:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.cgi-handler">CGI-Handler=</a>bar.cgi
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      causes the program "<code>bar.cgi</code>" to be run and its output to be
      served in place of the document requested.  This is a way to designate a
      CGI program to handle a file somewhat like a filter.  The name of the
      program need not be in the URL since it is in the <a
      href="index_desc.html#index"><code>index.wn</code></a> file.  So when
      <code>http://host/foo.html</code> is requested this will cause the
      handler, <code>bar.cgi</code>, to be run with the CGI environment
      variable <a
      href="appendixD.html#cgi.PATH_INFO"><code>PATH_INFO</code></a> set to
      <code>/path2/foo.html</code>.  In normal use the program
      <code>bar.cgi</code> will do something to the file <code>foo.html</code>
      and serve the output.  It is useful if you want a number of files in a
      directory to be handled by the same CGI program.  Note the file
      <code>foo.html</code> need not be used in any way by the program, but it
      must exist or else the server will treat it as a non-existent file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The directory directive "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.default-cgi-handler">Default-CGI-Handler=</a>handler.cgi</code>"
      specifies that all files in the directory should be treated as if the
      "<code><a href="appendixB.html#fdir.cgi-handler">CGI-Handler=</a></code>"
      file directive had been set to <code>handler.cgi</code>.  To override
      this setting and specify no CGI handler use the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.cgi-handler">CGI-Handler=</a>&lt;none&gt;</code>"
      directive.
    </p>
