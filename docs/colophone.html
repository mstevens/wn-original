    <p>
      The <a href="manual.html">User's Guide for the <em>WN</em> Server</a> was
      written by <a href="mailto:john@math.northwestern.edu">John Franks</a> who is also
      the author of the <em>WN</em> software.  Editorial changes and cleanup of
      the HTML source for the User's Guide was contributed by <a
      href="mailto:jplejacq@quoininc.com">Jean Pierre LeJacq</a>.  This
      colophon describes the approach and tools used to write and validate the
      HTML source code.
    </p>



    <h3>I.1 <a name="goals">Goals</a></h3>

    <p>
      We had the following goals for the HTML source code:
    </p>


    <h4>I.1.1 <a name="goals.valid">Valid HTML</a></h4>

    <p>
      <em>WN</em> emphasizes the adherence the Internet standards such as <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/Markup/">HTML</a> and <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/Protocols/">HTTP</a>.  Basically, we want to
      practice what we preach in the documentation for <em>WN</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The User's Guide was written using <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32.html">HTML 3.2</a> instead of the
      more recent <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/">HTML 4.0</a> since
      the former is currently better supported in both textual and graphical
      browsers.
    </p>


    <h4>I.1.2 <a name="goals.valid">HTML That Follows Good Style</a></h4>

    <p>
      As with any language, valid HTML can be written in a way that makes it
      difficult to maintain, non-portable and against the basic principles HTML
      embodies.  </p>

    <p>
      For example of the latter, we consider HTML primarily as a language that
      describes the semantic <em>structure</em> and not the visual
      representation of documents.  Consequently, only minor use of HTML tags
      was made for formatting (e.g. centering of a documents title).  Even
      these minor formatting decisions could be eliminated through the use of
      <a href="http://www.w3c.org/Style/">Style Sheets</a>.  However, these are
      currently not well supported by many browsers so they were not employed.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an example or more minor portability issue, we check that there is no
      intervening white space in the start of an anchor, "<a
      href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/wilbur/special/a.html">&lt;a&gt;</a>",
      tag.  Browsers are inconsistent in how the display this extra white
      space.
    </p>
      

    <h4>I.1.3 <a name="goals.links">Extensive Use of Valid Links</a></h4>

    <p>
      One of the great strengths of HTML is the linking of widely dispersed
      documents to create a seamless <em>virtual</em> document.  We have
      provided extensive links to relevant standards, manual pages and sites to
      maximize this advantage.  The User's Guide itself is extensively
      cross-linked.  We also wanted to insure that the links were valid.
    </p>


    <h4>I.1.4 <a name="goals.example">Example of Well Written HTML</a></h4>

    <p>
      One of the unfortunate consequences of the popularity of the Internet is
      the low quality of much of the HTML documents.  Since learning by example
      is so important, we wanted to provide <em>WN</em> users an example of
      well written HTML.
    </p>

    
    <h3>I.2 <a name="tools">Tools</a></h3>

    <h4>I.2.1 <a name="tools.os">Operating Systems</a></h4>

    <h5>I.2.1.1 <a name="tools.os.linux">Linux</a></h5>

    <p>
      All of the editing and validation of the User's Guide was done using the
      <a href="http://www.linuxhq.org/">Linux Operating System</a> developed
      primarily by <a href="mailto:torvalds@transmeta.com">Linus Torvalds</a>.
      We used the <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a>
      distribution developed by many volunteers on the Internet.  Much of the
      editing was done as part of the packaging of <em>WN</em> for Debian.
    </p>


    <h4>I.2.2 <a name="tools.editors">Editors</a></h4>

    <h5>I.2.2.1 <a name="tools.editors.xemacs">Xemacs Editor</a></h5>

    <p>
      All of the editing of the User's Guide was done using the <a
      href="http://www.xemacs.org/">Xemacs</a> text editor.  XEmacs stems from
      a collaboration of Lucid, Inc. with <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun
      Microsystems, Inc.</a> and the <a
      href="http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/">University of Illinois</a> with additional
      support having been provided by <a href="http://www.amdahl.com/">Amdahl
      Corporation</a>, <a href="http://www.altrasoft.com/">Altrasoft</a> and a
      huge amount of volunteer effort.
    </p>

    <p>
      Much of the power of Xemacs is based on the lisp packages that are either
      part of the core Xemacs distribution or add-ons.  We cannot list all of
      the packages but I do follow with several particularly important packages
      for editing HTML documents.
    </p>


    <h6>I.2.2.1.1 <a name="tools.editors.xemacs.hm--html-menus">Emacs
    <code>hm--html-menus</code> Mode</a></h6>

    <p>
      The <a
      href="http://www.tnt.uni-hannover.de/~muenkel/software/own/hm--html-menus/overview.html"><code>hm--html-menus</code></a>
      package provides functions and various popup and pulldown menus for a
      HTML mode called <code>hm--html-mode</code>, a mode for writing HTML
      pages.  The primary author is <a
      href="mailto:muenkel@tnt.uni-hannover.de">Heiko Muenkel</a>.  It provides
      also a minor mode, <code>hm--html-minor-mode</code>, which can be used
      together with another HTML major mode, like the <a
      href="#tools.editors.xemacs.psgml"><code>psgml-html</code> mode</a> which
      is exactly what we did.
    </p>


    <h6>I.2.2.1.2 <a name="tools.editors.xemacs.psgml">Emacs <code>psgml</code>
    Mode</a></h6>

    <p>
      <a
      href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/projects/about_psgml.html"><code>psgml</code></a>
      is a major mode for editing <a href="http://www.sgml.org/">SGML</a>
      documents.  <code>psgml</code> contains a simple SGML parser and can work
      with any DTD.  Functions provided includes menus and commands for
      inserting tags with only the contextually valid tags, identification of
      structural errors, editing of attribute values in a separate window with
      information about types and defaults and structure based editing.  It
      also provides an interface to an external SGML parser, such as <a
      href="#tools.validators.sp">SP</a>, to rigorously validate a file.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>psgml</code> is currently maintained by <a
      href="mailto:lenst@lysator.liu.se">Lennart Staflin</a>.
    </p>


    <h6>I.2.2.1.3 <a name="tools.editors.xemacs.w3">Emacs/W3 Browser</a></h6>

    <p>
      <a
      href="http://http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html">Emacs/W3</a>
      is a full-featured web browser, written entirely in Emacs-Lisp, that
      supports all the bells and whistles you will find in use on the web
      today, including frames, tables, stylesheets, and much more.  We used as
      a quick validation of the basic presentation of the pages.
    </p>



    <h4>I.2.3 <a name="tools.validators">Validators</a></h4>

    <h5>I.2.3.1 <a name="tools.validators.sp">SP SGML Parser</a></h5>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.jclark.com/sp/">SP</a> is a free object-oriented
      toolkit for SGML parsing and entity management developed by <a
      href="mailto:jjc@jclark.com">James Clark</a>.  It includes the <a
      href="http://www.jclark.com/sp/nsgmls.htm"><code>nsgmls</code></a>
      program which parses and validates the SGML documents whose document
      entity is specified by the system identifiers sysid.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="#tools.editors.xemacs.psgml">Emacs <code>psgml</code>
      mode</a> supports invoking <code>nsgmls</code> and parsing its output.
      We used the following sysid at the beginning of all HTML documents:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;!doctype html public "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>



    <h5>I.2.3.2 <a name="tools.validators.weblint">Weblint HTML Style
    Checker</a></h5>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.cre.canon.co.uk/~neilb/weblint/">Weblint</a> is a <a
      href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> program for syntax and minimal style
      checking of HTML developed by <a href="mailto:neilb@cre.canon.co.uk">Neil
      Bowers</a>.  We use in conjunction to <a
      href="#tools.validators.sp">SP</a> to prevent the use of valid HTML that
      is either difficult to maintain or poorly supported by current browsers.
    </p>


    <h5>I.2.3.3 <a name="tools.validators.linbot">Linbot HTML Link
    Checker</a></h5>

    <p>
      <a href="http://starship.skyport.net/crew/marduk/linbot/">linbot</a> is a
      <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> program that allows
      webmasters to: view the structure of a site; track down broken links;
      find potentially outdated HTML pages; list links pointing to external
      sites; view portfolio of inline images; and do all this periodically and
      without user intervention.  Results are displayed in a set of HTML pages.
    </p>
