The WN home pages are at http://www.wnserver.org/ (Europe) and
http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/ (U.S.) and information
about the latest version can be found there.

This version of WN comes with a "configure" perl script.  See the
README.configure file for details.  If you don't have perl you can
copy config.h.dist to config.h and Makefile.dist to Makefile and edit
each of them manually.

Let me know of any problems with the "configure" script.

The file QUICKSTART has instructions for a quick installation.  I
recommend reading at least the "Installation and Setup" chapter of the
users' guide. The quickest way to do this is with a Web browser and
