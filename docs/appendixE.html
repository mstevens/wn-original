    <h2 align="center">Creating User Home Pages for the <em>WN</em>
    Server</h2>
    <hr size="4">

    <p>
      This document is for the ordinary user, not the system "webmaster".  It
      is intended as a short description of how to use the <em>WN</em> server
      to set up your home page (and related documents if you wish).  It is not
      a primer on writing HTML.  There are many of those -- <a
      href="#html">some are listed below</a>.  Instead it deals with what to do
      with a home page document after it is created to put it "on the Web".  We
      assume that your system administrator has already set up the <em>WN</em>
      server in such a way that users are permitted to have home pages in their
      own directories.  If that isn't the case you will have to persuade your
      local administrator to do so or read the full "<a
      href="manual.html">User's Guide for the <em>WN</em> Server</a>" to learn
      how to do it yourself.
    </p>


    <h3>E.1 <a name="starting">Getting Started</a></h3>

    <p>
      But let's be optimistic and suppose everything is set up and working
      properly.  If you haven't created a home page here is a bare bones one
      you can copy to expand on later:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;!doctype&nbsp;html&nbsp;public&nbsp;"-//W3C//DTD&nbsp;HTML&nbsp;3.2&nbsp;Final//EN"&gt;
        <br>
        &lt;head&gt;
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;John Doe's Home Page&lt;/title&gt;
        <br>
        &lt;/head&gt;
        <br>
        &lt;body&gt;
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;John Doe's Home Page&lt;/h1&gt;
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the story of my life...
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        <br>
        &lt;/body&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Your home page and any other files you want to serve must be located in
      a particular subdirectory of your home directory (your home directory is
      where you are when you first login) on the UNIX system which is running
      the <em>WN</em> server.  Usually this subdirectory is called
      <code>public_html</code>, but your system webmaster may have chosen
      something different.  We'll assume the name is <code>public_html</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      It probably doesn't yet exist in your home directory. If not create it
      with the command:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        mkdir&nbsp;public_html&lt;Enter&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The <code>public_html</code> directory also must have the correct
      "permissions" so that the server can look inside it.  For security
      reasons the <em>WN</em> server isn't very powerful and it can only
      access files and directories which are not heavily protected.  Just to
      make sure the server won't have trouble accessing your home page run the
      command:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        chmod&nbsp;755&nbsp;public_html&lt;Enter&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      You must place a copy of your home page in this directory and give it
      the name <code>index.html</code>.  One way to do this is enter the
      <code>public_html</code> directory and use an editor to create the home
      page file there with the name <code>index.html</code>.  Alternatively,
      you could create it elsewhere and copy it to the
      <code>public_html</code> directory.  If you need to rename it the proper
      UNIX command is:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        mv&nbsp;oldname&nbsp;newname&lt;Enter&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>


    <p>
      Of course the server must also be able to read your home page in order
      to serve it.  If documents you create are automatically protected from
      viewing by others you will have to change that for your home page.  The
      command:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        chmod&nbsp;644&nbsp;index.html&lt;Enter&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      gives anyone (including the server) permission to read but not change
      your home page.
    </p>



    <h3>E.2 <a name="security">Granting Access to Your Home Page</a></h3>

    <p>
      There is one more step before your home page is available to the world.
      The <em>WN</em> server is very security conscious.  It is much more
      careful about refusing to serve documents which users did not intend to
      be served.  This means that in addition to serving only documents in
      designated directories (such as your "<code>public_html</code>") it will
      only serve documents which have been explicitly designated for serving
      in some way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are two different ways to grant the server permission to serve your
      home page.  You only need to do one of these.
    </p>


    <h4>E.2.1 <a name="security.lazy">A Lazy Way</a></h4>

    <p>
      Create a file in the <code>public_html</code> directory named
      <code>index.wn</code> which contains the line:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        Attribute=serveall
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Then execute the command:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        wndex&lt;Enter&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      which will create the file "<code>index.cache</code>".  It grants the
      server permission to serve anything in this directory.  If you put
      documents to be served in subdirectories of <code>public_html</code>,
      copy the file <code>index.wn</code> to them also and rerun
      <code>wndex</code> in these subdirectories to grant permission to serve
      anything from them (actually the file "<code>index.wn</code>" itself is
      excluded from being served as are files beginning with the
      '<code>.</code>' character).
    </p>


    <h4>E.2.2 <a name="security.better">A Better Way</a></h4>

    <p>
      Create a file in the <code>public_html</code> directory named
      <code>index.wn</code> which contains the line:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        File=index.html
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      If you have other files you want to serve add additional lines like
      "<code>File=foo.html</code>" where <code>foo.html</code> is the name of
      the file you want to serve. Then execute the command:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        wndex&lt;Enter&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Files which are HTML files should have names which end with the suffix
      "<code>.html</code>".  Files which are ASCII text files should end with
      "<code>.txt</code>" and PNG image files should end with
      "<code>.png</code>".  Executing the "<code>wndex</code>" (pronounced
      "windex") command will create the file "<code>index.cache</code>" as
      before, but now the server will only have permission to serve those
      files whose names are listed explicitly in your <code>index.wn</code> file.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you put documents to be served in subdirectories of
      <code>public_html</code>, you must create an <code>index.wn</code> file in
      each of them also which lists the files which can be served.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "better way", in addition to providing better security, also enables
      many of the advanced features of the <em>WN</em> server, such as
      searching capabilities.  In the long run if you serve multiple documents
      you will probably want to use it.  The trade off is that the "lazy" way
      is easier since it only needs to be done once, while the "better" way
      requires that you edit the <code>index.wn</code> file and rerun
      <code>wndex</code> each time you add a new file to
      <code>public_html</code> to be served.
    </p>


    <h3>E.3 <a name="url">What's Your URL?</a></h3>

    <p>
      So once your home page is functional, how do you access it?  Well, your
      home page address (called a URL which stands for "Uniform Resource
      Locator") is made up from the name of your host and your user name.  For
      example, if your user name is <code>jdoe</code> and the computer on
      which the server is running is named <code>www.school.edu</code> then
      the URL for your home page is probably:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        http://www.school.edu/~jdoe/
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The "probably" refers to the fact that there are many possible variations
      which may have been chosen by your webmaster.  For example, some people
      don't like the '<code>~</code>' character in URL's so they might use
      "<code>http://www.school.edu/homepages/jdoe/</code>".  In any case there
      are a couple of things to notice about your URL.
    </p>

    <p>
      First it has a synonym:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        http://www.school.edu/~jdoe/index.html
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This is because whenever a URL ends in '<code>/</code>' the server knows
      it is referring to a directory (in this case your
      <code>public_html</code> directory) and looks for the default file
      "<code>index.html</code>" in that directory.  Thus if you want to put
      some files in subdirectories of <code>public_html</code> that is fine.
      But keep in mind that if you create the directory "<code>mydir</code>" in
      <code>public_html</code> then
      "<code>http://www.school.edu/~jdoe/mydir/</code>" will really refer to
      "<code>http://www.school.edu/~jdoe/mydir/index.html</code>" and to refer
      to a file "<code>foo.png</code>" in <code>mydir</code> you should use
      "<code>http://www.school.edu/~jdoe/mydir/foo.png</code>".  You should not
      use the URL "<code>http://www.school.edu/~jdoe/mydir</code>" referring to
      a directory but with no '<code>/</code>' at the end.
    </p>


    <h3>E.4 <a name="advanced">Advanced Features</a></h3>

    <p>
      There are many advanced features you can use with the <em>WN</em> server.
      To learn to use them you will need to read parts of the <a
      href="manual.html">manual</a> designed for system administrators.  A good
      place to start is the chapter "<a href="overview.html">An Overview of the
      <em>WN</em> Server</a>" in this guide.  It will give you a good idea of
      some of the things the server can do.  Then you will likely also want to
      consult the chapter "<a href="index_desc.html">Creating Your <em>WN</em>
      Data Directory</a>" in this guide.  Neither of these chapters is too
      long.
    </p>


    <h3>E.5 <a name="html">HTML References</a></h3>

    <p>
      To find out more about composing HTML documents consult "<a
      href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">A
      Beginner's Guide to HTML</a>" (at
