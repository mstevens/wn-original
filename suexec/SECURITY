This directory contains source for suexec and instructions on how to
use it with WN (2.3.9 and later).  This program is normally used as a
setuid root program and that involves a number of security issues.
Any setuid root program is dangerous.

There are special considerations for using this program with WN.  The
program "suexec" should *only* be executable by the user under which
your server runs (say www) and *only* when called by the WN binary.
Some do's and don'ts:

1) DO make the suexec executable ONLY by user www (and root).

2) DON'T allow a version of WN compiled without suexec support to be run as user www
if you have an available suexec.

3) Compile suexec restricting the users it can change to as much as possible.

Earlier I wrote, "The problem is if any user can run this suexec
he/she can change his/her identity for running subsequent programs.
If 2) above is not adhered to then WN can run suexec in a cgi script
and do bad things as any user."  This problem should no longer be as
serious (version 2.3.10 and later) as the current suexec will only 
run when given a hashed secret by the WN server.
