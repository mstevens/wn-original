     <h2 align="center">Using Default Cache Files with the <em>WN</em>
     Server</h2>

     <p align="center"><em>(this chapter contributed by Doug Hardie)</em></p>
     <hr size="4">

     <p>
       This document is for the system "webmaster".  It addresses an
       approach to management of the Cache files that may be useful in
       some special situations.  Normally <em>WN</em> will not serve a
       file from a directory unless there is a Cache file in that
       directory that authorizes the serving of that file.  Default
       Cache Files provides an alternative approach to Cache files for
       those situations where maintaining the Cache file in a specific
       directory is not viable.
     </p>

     <p>
      The use of Default Cache files requires the administrator to
      carefully design and control the web space as it is possible to
      create situations where the security and protection mechanisms
      can be bypassed through the incorrect use of Default Cache
      files.  Most <em>WN</em> installations do not need, and should
      not have, Default Cache files enabled.
     </p>


     <h3>17.1 <a name="examples">Example Situations Where Default Cache files may be helpful</a></h3>

     <p>
       The most obvious example of a situation where Default Cache
       files are useful is to serve data from read-only media such as
       a CD ROM where it is impossible to create cache files in each
       directory from which you wish to serve documents.
     </p>

     <p>
       Another example environment where Default Cache files may be useful
       is in a situation where there are individual user web pages.
       In this case it may not be reasonable to expect the individual
       users to create and properly maintain the Cache files.  In this
       situation you might want to create a default cache file for all
       user web pages.
     </p>

     <p>
       However, there are some potential pitfalls with this approach.
       If the user web pages are only available to the users through
       ftp, then you can properly control the situation.  If the users
       can login to the web server you may have problems with
       users establishing links to directories/files outside the web
       space. For instance, a user could establish a link to the
       system password file and it would then be served.  It is
       probably not a good idea to use Default Cache files if the
       users have the ability to establish links.  The same probably
       applies for executable programs or cgi's.
     </p>

     <p>
       Another example would be for a server that has a large web
       space for which everything in that space is to be served.
       While this can be handled by using a Cache file with serveall
       in every directory, that may be tedious to setup and maintain.
       A Default Cache file for that web space will provide the same
       effect.
    </p>

     <p>
       Again, the administrator has to be careful to ensure that there
       are no unexpected links or cgi's.
     </p>

     <p>
       If you believe you have a use for Default Cache files, then you
       will need to rebuild the <em>WN</em> server to include the
       DEFAULT_CACHEFILE_LIST option as described below.
     </p>

     <h3>17.2 <a name="configuring">Configuring the <em>WN</em> Server for Default Cache Files</a></h3>

     <p>
       To configure <em>WN</em> for Default Cache files, you must
       first decide where you are going to put a cache file list that
       contains the listing of the Default Cache files to be used.
       For the examples used in this document, the cache file list is
       in <code>/www/bin/cachefilelist</code>.
     </p>

     <p>
       Then you must edit config.h and change <code>USE_DEF_CACHE_LIST</code> to
       <code>TRUE</code>.  The default is <code>FALSE.</code>
     </p>

     <blockquote>
       <code>
                 #define USE_DEF_CACHE_LIST   (TRUE)
       </code>
     </blockquote>

       Then you must set the macro <code>USE_DEF_CACHE_LIST</code> to
       the complete system path to a file containing the list of
       default cache files.  In this example the command would look
       like:

      <blockquote>
       <code>
           #define DEFAULT_CACHEFILE_LIST "/www/bin/cachefilelist"
       </code>
     </blockquote>


     <p>
       Then you need to create the default cache files.  They are best
       created by creating an index file as described previously and
       using wndex to create the cache file.  You may want to have
       several different default cache files for separate portions of
       the web space.  Once the default cache files are established,
       enter them into the cache file list.  For example, two default
       cache files are desired: <code>/www/bin/cache/users</code> and
       <code>/www/bin/cache/web.</code> Create these files using wndex
       and then create /www/bin/cachefilelist using the following
       format:
     </p>

     <blockquote>
       <code>
         # Default cache file for public web pages<br>
         /www/docs/pub/*   /www/bin/cache/web<br>
	 <br>
         # Default cache file for user home pages<br>
         /usr/home/*/public_html/*       /www/bin/cache/users<br>
	 <br>
         # Default cache file for a single directory<br>
         /www/test         /www/bin/cache/single<br>
	 <br>
         # Default cache file for user home pages in sub directories<br>
         /usr/home/??/*    /www/bin/cache/users<br>
       </code>
     </blockquote>

     <p> The first entry on each line is a directory in the web space
       which, will use a default cache file.  The second entry on the
       line is the path to the cache file you want to use.  This
       cache file must be in a directory in the WN data
       hierarchy. Comments in this file are anything on a line after
       the first '#'.  The first entry may contain the wildcards '*'
       and '?' which behave in the same way they do as shell
       metacharacters.
     </p>

     <p>
       In the first entry of the example above the web pages in
       /www/docs/pub and its subdirectories will use the
       <code>web</code> default cache page.  For the second entry,
       anything in public_html directory inside a user home directory
       (e.g. <code>/usr/home/bob/public_html/whatever.html</code>)
       will use the <code>web</code> default cache page.  All other
       pages must have a cache file in the directory of the requested
       page.  In the third entry, only files in /www/test will use the
       default cache file.  Subdirectories must have their own cache
       files.  The fourth entry shows how a large number of home pages
       could be split into multiple directories - each having two
       characters in their names (e.g., <code>00 - 99</code>).  Other directories
       in /usr/home will not use the default cache file.
     </p>

     <p>
       Note, all the default cache files and the cache file list must
       be owned and have the same permissions as a normal cache file.
       If a cache file exists in a directory it will always be used in
       place of the default.
     </p>

     <p>
       It is possible for a directory to use a default cache file and a
       subdirectory to use a real cache file.  If a directory matches more
       than one item in the cache file list the first matching entry
       will be used.
     </p>

     <h3>17.3 <a name="cachecontents">The Contents of a Default Cache File</a></h3>

     <p>
       The default cache file can contain any WN cache file
       directive. However, in general the serveall directive will be
       necessary.  While directives for specific files can be
       included, that is probably not a good approach since those
       files only exist in one directory.  You should use a cache file
       in the directory for those situations.  Other directives such
       as the default content may be helpful.
     </p>

     <h3>17.4 <a name="maintaining">Maintaining the Default Cache Files</a></h3>

     <p>
       Once the <em>WN</em> server is running with Default Cache
       files, you may need to make changes.  The Default Cache files
       themselves can be updated just like normal cache files.
       Likewise changes to the cache file list can be made while the
       server is operational. You do not need to restart the
       <em>WN</em> server for changes to either.
     </p>
