    <h2 align="center">Creating Your <em>WN</em> Data Directory</h2>
    <hr size="4">



    <h3>3.1 <a name="index">The <code>index.wn</code> file</a></h3>

    <p>
      In each directory of your data hierarchy you create a file called
      <code>index.wn</code> with information about each file you want to serve.
      The simplest <code>index.wn</code> file might contain the single line:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a
        href="appendixB.html#ddir.attributes.serveall">Attributes=serveall</a>
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      which when properly processed will grant the server permission to serve
      any file in the directory (but not in subdirectories).  For more
      information about this directive see the section on the <a
      href="#serveall"><code>serveall</code></a> attribute below.  A more
      elaborate <code>index.wn</code> file might look like the following:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a
        href="appendixB.html#ddir.owner">Owner=</a>mailto:webmistress@host.edu
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.file">File=</a>file.txt
        <br>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.title">Title=</a>This is a descriptive
        title for file.txt
        <br>
        <br>
        # This is a comment
        <br>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.file">File=</a>file2.html
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.file">File=</a>soundfile
        <br>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.title">Title=</a>This plays some sounds
        <br>
        <a
        href="appendixB.html#fdir.content-type">Content-type=</a>audio/basic
        <br>
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The file contains four groups of lines called records.  The first record
      (the single line starting <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.owner">Owner=</a></code> in this example)
      describes properties of the directory and is called the <a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir">directory record</a>.  It can be empty, but in
      general it is a good idea for the directory record to contain an owner
      line, like the one above, referring to the maintainer of the directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      The remainder of this <code>index.wn</code> file has three <a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir">file records</a> describing three files,
      <code>file.txt</code>, <code>file2.html</code> and
      <code>soundfile</code>, in the directory which we wish to serve. The line
      starting with '<code>#</code>' is a comment.  Wherever a '<code>#</code>'
      occurs the remainder of that line is treated as a comment (i.e. ignored).
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>index.wn</code> file is processed with the utility <a
      href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code></a> (pronounced "windex") to produce a
      small database called <code>index.cache</code> containing information
      about this directory and its contents.  Detailed information on the <a
      href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code> utility</a> is given below, but simply
      running it with no arguments in a directory containing an
      <code>index.wn</code> file will produce the <code>index.cache</code> file
      for that directory.  This file contains all the information in the
      <code>index.wn</code> file plus additional information gathered
      automatically about the files to be served.  In particular the
      <code>index.cache</code> file will list the names of the files given in
      the <code><a href="appendixB.html#fdir.file">File=</a></code> lines of the
      <code>index.wn</code> file.  Any file on the server whose name is not listed
      in an <code>index.cache</code> file will not be served.  This is the
      basis of <em>WN</em> security.  For security reasons the server will
      refuse to use any <code>index.cache</code> file which is in reality a
      symbolic link to another file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>index.cache</code> database has a number of other functions
      beyond its security role.  Attributes of the files listed in the
      <code>index.wn</code> file which can be computed before they are served and
      which don't often change are stored in the <code>index.cache</code> file.
      For example, the <code>MIME</code> content type of <code>soundfile</code>
      is read from the <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.content-type">Content-type=</a></code> line.
      The other files do not need such a line since <a
      href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code></a> can deduce from the file name
      extensions that <code>file.txt</code> has type <code>text/plain</code>
      and <code>file2.html</code> has type <code>text/html</code>.  This is
      done once at the time <code>index.cache</code> is created and need not be
      done every time the file is served.  By the way, if the sound file were
      named <code>soundfile.au</code> it wouldn't need a
      <code>Content-type</code> line either.
    </p>

    <p>
      The title of a file is another example of information stored in the
      <code>index.cache</code> file.  With the <em>WN</em> server every file
      served has a title (even binaries) and optionally has a list of keywords
      associated with it.  For an HTML document the title and the keywords are
      automatically extracted by <a href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code></a> from
      the header of the document and stored in fields of that file's line in
      <code>index.cache</code>.  These are used for the built-in keyword and
      title <a href="search.html">searches</a> which the server supports.
    </p>



    <h3>3.2 <a name="file_owner">File Ownership and Permissions</a></h3>

    <p>
      The files which you wish to serve should be owned by you, or by their
      creator, or by whoever is in charge of maintaining them.  They should not
      be owned by <code>nobody</code> or whatever user id the server runs under
      as set in <a href="configmacros.html#USERID"><code>config.h</code></a>.
      This because the <code>nobody</code> id should have the minimum
      permissions possible.  It needs to have read access to the files to be
      served, but it has no need to be able to write to those files or alter
      them in any way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus normally the files served might be owned by the maintainer and have
      their permissions set to be world readable but writable only by the
      maintainer (or by no one).
    </p>

    <p>
      Likewise the <code>index.cache</code> file which controls access to
      everything in a directory should be owned by the maintainer of that
      directory and the only permission <code>nobody</code> should have for
      this file is read permission.  In fact, for security reasons it the
      server was started as <code>root</code> (and then switched to a safer
      user like <code>nobody</code>) <code>wnd</code> or <code>wnsd</code> will
      refuse to use any <code>index.cache</code> file which is owned by the
      user id (e.g. <code>nobody</code>) under which the server is running.
      This restriction does not apply if <code>wnsd</code> is run on an
      unprivileged port by an ordinary user, because such a user might not be
      able to make <code>index.cache</code> files owned by someone else.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is one exception to the rule of having nothing owned by
      <code>nobody</code> (and that's not a double negative).  The exception is
      the log files.  These files must be writable by the server and it
      generally seems sensible to have them owned by the user
      <code>nobody</code> under whose identity the server runs. The log file
      and the error log file can be specified on the command line when the
      server is run or can be set in the <a
      href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> with the <a
      href="configmacros.html#WN_LOGFILE"><code>#define&nbsp;WN_LOGFILE</code></a>
      and <a
      href="configmacros.html#WN_ERRLOGFILE"><code>#define&nbsp;WN_ERRLOGFILE</code></a>
      macros.
    </p>



    <h3>3.3 <a name="wndex">Using the <code>wndex</code> Utility</a></h3>

    <p>
      Before describing the <code>index.wn</code> file in greater detail we
      briefly explain the use of the program which reads this file and produces
      the <code>index.cache</code> database file.  Simply running
      <code>wndex</code> with no arguments in a directory containing a file
      named <code>index.wn</code> causes that file to be read and a file called
      <code>index.cache</code> to be created in that directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are several command line arguments for <code>wndex</code>.  The <a
      href="appendixA2.html#r_opt"><code>-r</code></a> option causes
      <code>wndex</code> to recursively descend your data hierarchy using all
      subdirectories listed in the <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.subdirs">Subdirs=</a></code> line of the
      directory record in the <code>index.wn</code> file (<a
      href="#dir_record">see below</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="appendixA2.html#i_opt"><code>-i</code></a> and <a
      href="appendixA2.html#c_opt"><code>-c</code></a> options specify an
      alternate name for the <code>index.wn</code> file and the
      <code>index.cache</code> file respectively.  For example the command:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        wndex&nbsp;-i&nbsp;foo&nbsp;-c&nbsp;bar
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      will attempt to use <code>foo</code> as the <code>index.wn</code> file and
      produce the file <code>bar</code> instead of <code>index.cache</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="appendixA2.html#d_opt"><code>-d</code></a> option specifies
      a directory other than the current directory in which to find the
      <code>index.wn</code> file and in which to create the
      <code>index.cache</code> and <code>index.html</code> files.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally the <a href="appendixA2.html#q_opt"><code>-q</code></a> option
      (for quiet) suppresses the printing of any warning or informational
      messages by <code>wndex</code>.
    </p>



    <h3>3.4 <a name="dir_record">The Directory Record</a></h3>

    <p>
      The first group of lines in an <code>index.wn</code> file provides
      information about the directory itself and the collection of files it
      contains rather than about any single file in the directory.  It is
      called the directory record. This beginning collection of lines might
      look like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a href="appendixB.html#ddir.owner">Owner=</a>mailto:you@host.edu
        <br>
        <a
        href="appendixB.html#ddir.searchwrapper">SearchWrapper=</a>dir_search_wrap
        <br>
        <a href="appendixB.html#ddir.accessfile">Accessfile=</a>/dir/access
        <br>
        <a href="appendixB.html#ddir.subdirs">Subdirs=</a>dir1,dir2,directory3
        <br>
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The <code><a href="appendixB.html#ddir.owner">Owner=</a></code> line
      specifies the owner of items in the directory (which is used in the <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/Protocols/">HTTP/1.1</a> headers sent by the
      server).
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.searchwrapper">SearchWrapper=</a></code> line
      specifies a "wrapper" for the various searches of the directory. That is
      an HTML document which provides a customized response listing the
      matching items in one of the various searches of the directory.  For more
      details see the chapter "<a href="parse.html">Parsed Text and Server Side
      Includes on the <em>WN</em> Server</a>" in this guide.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code><a href="appendixB.html#ddir.accessfile">Accessfile=</a></code>
      line specifies the name of the file which controls access (by IP address)
      to this directory.  If this item is omitted then items in the directory
      may be served to anyone.  For more information on using the access
      mechanism see the chapter "<a href="access.html">Limiting Access to Your
      <em>WN</em> Hierarchy</a>" in this guide.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally the line starting with <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.subdirs">Subdirs=</a></code> specifies the
      subdirectories of this directory which you wish to have recursively
      searched when a title or keyword search is done on this directory.  More
      information about searching can be found in the chapter "<a
      href="search.html">Setting Up Searches on the <em>WN</em> Server</a>" in
      this guide.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a complete list of the possible lines (called "directives") which a
      directory can have see the section "<a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir">Directory Directives</a>" in this guide.
    </p>



    <h3>3.5 <a name="file_records">File Records</a></h3>

    <p>
      After the directory record line group an <code>index.wn</code> file will
      typically have groups of lines called file records describing a
      particular file.  A file record can be as simple as a single line like
      the line "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.file">File=</a>file2.html</code>" in the
      example above or it can contain several lines describing the file.  For a
      complete list of the possible lines (called "directives") which a file
      can have see the section "<a href="appendixB.html#fdir">File Directives</a>"
      in this guide.
    </p>



    <h3>3.6 <a name="default">Your Default Page</a></h3>

    <p>
      When someone sends a request to your server with only the server name and
      no file name like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        http://hopf.math.northwestern.edu/
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      the <em>WN</em> server automatically translates this to:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        http://hopf.math.northwestern.edu/index.html
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      adding the file name "<code>index.html</code>".  More generally if a
      request is made for a directory, say with the URL
      <code>http://host/dir1/dir2/</code>, this will be translated to a request
      for <code>http://host/dir1/dir2/index.html</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you wish the default file name in a particular directory to be
      something other than "<code>index.html</code>" you can use the <a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.default-document"><code>Default-Document=</code></a>
      directive in the directory record of your <code>index.wn</code> file to
      change it.  If you wish to change the default file name for all
      directories on the server you can change the <a
      href="configmacros.html#INDEXFILE_NAME"><code>#define&nbsp;INDEXFILE_NAME</code></a>
      line in the <a href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> file
      and recompile.
    </p>



    <h3>3.7 <a name="serveall">Serving Files not Listed in an
    <code>index.wn</code> File</a></h3>

    <p>
      <em>WN</em> is also able to serve files without explicitly listing them
      in an <code>index.wn</code> or <code>index.cache</code> file.  This is done
      by putting the line:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a
        href="appendixB.html#ddir.attributes.serveall">Attributes=serveall</a>
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      in the directory record of the <code>index.wn</code> file for a directory or
      by running <a href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code></a> with the <a
      href="appendixA2.html#a_opt"><code>-a</code></a> option.  Either of these
      specify that any file in this directory, which does not start with the
      character '<code>.</code>', or contain a '<code>~</code>', may be served,
      not just those listed in the <code>index.wn</code> file.  The files
      <code>index.wn</code> and <code>index.cache</code> will also not be served.
      (Indeed if the <a href="appendixA2.html#a_opt"><code>-a</code></a> option
      is used with <a href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code></a> there need not even
      be an <code>index.wn</code> file, because an <code>index.cache</code> file
      will be created just as if the <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.attributes.serveall">Attributes=serveall</a></code>
      directive had been used.)
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>Note:</em> When this directive is used in a directory protected by an
      <a href="access.html#ip"><code>accessfile</code></a> or a <a
      href="access.html#authenticate">password file</a> be sure that these
      files have names that start with '<code>.</code>', or contain a
      '<code>~</code>'.  Or better, put these files in a different directory
      from which nothing is served.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      When the <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.attributes.serveall">Attributes=serveall</a></code>
      directive is used the server will attempt to set the content type
      correctly based on the file name suffix using the same default
      correspondences between type and suffix that <a
      href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code></a> uses.  Indeed when <a
      href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code></a> is run on a directory with the
      <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.attributes.serveall">Attributes=serveall</a></code>
      directive, it behaves as if all files in the directory (except those
      starting with '<code>.</code>' or containing a '<code>~</code>') were
      listed with a <code><a href="appendixB.html#fdir.file">File=</a></code>
      directive.  If the <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.attributes.serveall">Attributes=serveall</a></code>
      line (and the corresponding entry it creates in the
      <code>index.cache</code> file) are not present then only the files
      explicitly listed with a <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.file">File=</a></code> directive will be
      served.
    </p>

    <p>
      The default correspondences between file name suffixes and MIME types are
      specified in the "<code>mime.types</code>" file.  A default version of
      the file is in <code>/lib/mime.types</code>.  The <code>mime.types</code>
      file should be installed in a known location.  The default location is in
      the <em>WN</em> <code>src</code> hierarchy, but this can be changed by
      specifying a different value when the <a
      href="setup.html#installing.configure"><code>configure</code></a> program
      is run or by editing the value of <a
      href="configmacros.html#MIME_TYPE_FILE"><code>#define&nbsp;MIME_TYPE_FILE</code></a>
      in <a href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a>.  The
      <code>mime.types</code> file exists so that you can add to it if you wish
      to add new kinds of documents to your server.  The format of the file is
      explained in the file.  If this file cannot be opened then <a
      href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code></a> will use compiled in defaults which
      are the same as what is currently in the default version of this file.
      The <code>mime.types</code> file is read whenever <a
      href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code></a> is run so <a
      href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code></a> always knows the latest additions.
      This file is also read by <code>wnsd</code> (but not <code>wnd</code>) on
      startup for use with directories with the <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.attributes.serveall">Attributes=serveall</a></code>
      directive.  The <code>wnsd</code> stand-alone server reads this file when
      it is started or restarted, but only takes note of new suffixes and their
      MIME types.  You cannot change the MIME type corresponding to one of the
      standard suffixes (as listed in the default <code>mime.types</code>
      file).  To do that you need to change the server source and recompile.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is fine to have file records in an <code>index.wn</code> file which also
      has the <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.attributes.serveall">Attributes=serveall</a></code>
      directive.  In this case the file directives take precedence.  Thus if
      you had an <code>index.wn</code> file consisting of:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a
        href="appendixB.html#ddir.attributes.serveall">Attributes=serveall</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.file">File=</a>foo.html
        <br>
        <a
        href="appendixB.html#fdir.content-type">Content-type=</a>application/postscript
        <br>
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      the server would consult the file record for "<code>foo.html</code>"
      first and see that it is of type <code>application/postscript</code> (it
      would be silly to actually do this, of course) and use that type.  But
      another file "<code>bar.html</code>" in the directory would also be
      served with the type indicated by its suffix.  Files with no file record
      in the <code>index.wn</code> file and no recognized suffix will be given the
      default content type which can set with the <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#defcon">Default-Content=</a></code> directive.
    </p>

    <p>
      When <a href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code></a> is run on an
      <code>index.wn</code> file with the <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.attributes.serveall">Attributes=serveall</a></code>
      directive all the files currently in that directory which can be served
      are given entries in the <code>index.cache</code> file.  <a
      href="search.html#title">Title</a> and <a
      href="search.html#keyword">keyword</a> searches only see files listed in
      an <code>index.cache</code> file.  Likewise <a
      href="search.html#context">context</a> and <a
      href="search.html#grep">grep</a> searches only seek matches in files
      listed in the <code>index.cache</code> file.  Thus if a file is added to
      a directory with the <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.attributes.serveall">Attributes=serveall</a></code>
      directive it will not be visible to searches unless <a
      href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code></a> is re-run in that directory.  If it
      has not been re-run the file will still be served, however.  Still, it is
      good practice to re-run <a href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code></a> every
      time you add or delete a file in a directory with the <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.attributes.serveall">Attributes=serveall</a></code>
      directive.  (Of course, it is required to do this for a directory without
      the <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.attributes.serveall">Attributes=serveall</a></code>
      directive.)  There is no need to re-run <a
      href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code></a> if you only change an existing file,
      unless you change its title or keywords.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no way to use <a href="parse.html">wrappers or includes</a> for
      files not listed in the <code>index.wn</code> file.  So generally, the few
      seconds it takes to add a document's name and a descriptive title to your
      <code>index.wn</code> file and then to run <a
      href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code></a> will pay off.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you do not wish the <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.attributes.serveall">Attributes=serveall</a></code>
      directive to be allowed on your server you can disable it by uncommenting
      the "<a
      href="configmacros.html#NO_SERVEALL"><code>#define&nbsp;NO_SERVEALL</code></a>"
      line in the <a href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> file.
      This does not affect the ability of <a
      href="#wndex"><code>wndex</code></a> to write <code>index.cache</code>
      entries for all files in a directory with the <code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.attributes.serveall">Attributes=serveall</a></code>
      directive.  But it means the server will only serve files listed an
      <code>index.cache</code> file.

    <h3>3.8 <a name="msgs_error">Customized Error Messages</a></h3>

    <p>
      There are three situations when the client request will be denied but for
      which you can supply customized error messages. These are requests for
      non-existent files, requests for files which require a password but for
      which no valid password was given, and requests from an invalid host for
      files limited to certain hosts.  The lines:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a
        href="appendixB.html#ddir.no-such-file-url">No-Such-File-URL=</a>http://host/dir/nosuch.html
        <br>
        <a
        href="appendixB.html#ddir.access-denied-url">Access-denied-URL=</a>http://host/dir/noaccess.html
        <br>
        <a
        href="appendixB.html#ddir.auth-denied-file">Auth-denied-file=</a>~/dir/nopassword.html
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      in a <a href="#dir_recore">directory record</a> of an <code>index.wn</code>
      file specify URL's to which clients are redirected when a non-existent
      file is requested and when a document protected by an <a
      href="access.html#ip">access control file</a> is requested from an
      invalid host.  The last line specifies a file to be sent when a password
      protected file is requested without a password or with an invalid
      password.  For technical reasons it wouldn't work to have this be a
      redirection.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the first two lines above (specifying redirection) the URL's given can
      be relative URL's, so the lines:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a
        href="appendixB.html#ddir.no-such-file-url">No-Such-File-URL=</a>/dir/nosuch.html
        <br>
        <a
        href="appendixB.html#ddir.access-denied-url">Access-denied-URL=</a>noaccess.html
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      are valid.  Default values for these three directives may be specified by
      editing the <a href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> file
      and recompiling the server.  More information on customized error
      messages can be found in section "<a href="appendixB.html#ddir">Directory
      Directives</a>" in this guide.
