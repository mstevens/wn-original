    <h2 align="center">Parsed Text and Server Side Includes on the <em>WN</em>
    Server</h2>
    <hr size="4">

    <p>
      The <em>WN</em> server has powerful capabilities for modifying an HTML
      file as it is served.  One such feature, called "server-side includes",
      is the ability to automatically insert one file in another.  But the
      usefulness of this capability is greatly enhanced by another feature, <a
      href="#if">conditional text</a>.  A simple "<code>if - else -
      endif</code>" construct allows sections of a document to be served only
      to certain hosts, or to clients providing an appropriate
      <code>Accept</code> header or a desired <code>Referer</code> or
      <code>User-Agent</code> header.  Using the "<code>else</code>" construct
      allows alternate text segments for clients not meeting the desired
      criteria.  For these features to work it is necessary for the server to
      parse the file looking for the location of includes or for conditionally
      served text.  The fact that a file should be parsed in this way is
      indicated in its entry in its <code><a
      href="index_desc.html#index">index.wn</a></code> file.  This is done with
      an entry "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.attributes.parse">Attributes=parse</a></code>"
      in the file record.  This line is not necessary if the file record lists
      <a href="#wrapping">wrappers</a> or <a href="#including">includes</a>
      since it is assumed in that case. Only documents with MIME type
      <code>text/html</code> can be parsed in this way.
    </p>



    <h3>6.1 <a name="wrappers">Wrappers, Includes, and List-Includes</a></h3>

    <p>
      The simplest and most common use of parsed text is including additional
      files in one which is being served or "wrapping" a served file with a
      second file, i.e. inserting the requested file inside the second at a
      desired location.  The latter is useful, for example, if you wish to
      place a standard message at the beginning or end (or both) of a large
      collection of files.  All files included or used as wrappers must be
      listed in the <code>index.cache</code> file.  They are not listed in the
      file in which they are to be included; only the location of the insertion
      is marked.
    </p>

    <p>
      To ensure security various options are available including the the
      requirement that a served file and all its includes and wrappers have the
      same owner as the <code>index.cache</code> file listing them.  This is
      done with the <a href="appendixA1.html#u_opt"><code>-u</code></a> option.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another important application of wrappers is to customize the <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/MarkUp/">HTML</a> documents returned listing the
      successful search matches.  If, for example, a directory is assigned a
      wrapper the server assumes that it contains all text describing the
      search and it merely supplies an unordered list of links to the matching
      items.
    </p>



    <h3>6.2 <a name="including">Simple Including</a></h3>

    <p>
      Suppose your server offers the file <code>foo.html</code> and you wish to
      have the file <code>bar.html</code> automatically inserted at some point
      into <code>foo.html</code>.  You achieve this by use of the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a></code>" directive in
      the <a href="index_desc.html#index"><code>index.wn</code></a> file in the
      directory containing <code>foo.html</code>.  That <code><a
      href="index_desc.html#index">index.wn</a></code> file should have an entry
      like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.file">File=</a>foo.html
        <br>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a>bar.html
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      and the file <code>foo.html</code> should contain either of the lines:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;!--&nbsp;#include&nbsp;--&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      or:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;?WN&nbsp;#include&nbsp;&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      These two forms are equivalent as far as the server is concerned.  The
      second form is considered more <a
      href="http://www.sil.org/sgml/sgml.html">SGML</a> friendly by many as
      <code>&lt;?WN&nbsp;something&gt;</code> indicates a processing
      instruction specific to <em>WN</em> rather than a comment.  For
      historical reasons this manual describes the other form, but either may
      be used.  With the first form the '<code>#</code>' is required but with
      the other you may use either:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;?WN #include&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      or:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;?WN include&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Any of the "<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#something&nbsp;--&gt;</code>" lines
      described in this section may be replaced using the
      "<code>&lt;?WN&nbsp;something&gt;</code>" syntax.  Also with this syntax
      the case of the <em>WN</em> is not significant.
    </p>

    <p>
      The marker "<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#include&nbsp;--&gt;</code>" should be the
      only thing on its line but may have white space before it.  This is
      controlled by the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a></code>" line in the
      <code><a href="index_desc.html#index">index.wn</a></code> file.  All
      including of files by <em>WN</em> is done only for text files and only in
      units of lines.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the include marker is never found in <code>foo.html</code>, then this
      file is served and the file <code>bar.html</code>, is appended at the
      end.  Thus the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a></code>" directive can
      be used to append a file without the need of any marker in the main file.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you wanted to include two files in <code>foo.html</code>, say
      <code>bar.html</code> and <code>bah.html</code> you would place the
      marker "<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#include&nbsp;--&gt;</code>" at two places in
      <code>foo.html</code> and have an entry in your <code><a
      href="index_desc.html#index">index.wn</a></code> file like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.file">File=</a>foo.html
        <br>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a>bar.html,bah.html
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The two files will then be included at the marked spots in the order that
      they are listed in the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a></code>" directive,
      i.e. <code>bar.html</code> will be inserted at the first marker and
      bah.html at the second.  You can have as many included files as you wish.
      They should all be listed on the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a></code>" line separated
      by commas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes it is easier to specify the order in which multiple files are
      to be inserted by adding the file name in the <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/MarkUp/">HTML</a> document.  This is also
      possible with <em>WN</em>.  However, since good security requires that
      only files listed in the <code><a
      href="index_desc.html#index">index.wn</a></code> file may be served, it is
      still necessary to list files you want to include there.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, another way to include two files in <code>foo.html</code>, say,
      <code>bar</code> and <code>bah</code>, is to place the markers
      '<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#include&nbsp;"bar"&nbsp;--&gt;</code>' and
      '<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#include&nbsp;"bah"&nbsp;--&gt;</code>' at the
      appropriate places in <code>foo.html</code> and have an entry in your
      <code><a href="index_desc.html#index">index.wn</a></code> file like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.file">File=</a>foo.html
        <br>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.list-includes">List-Includes=</a>bar,bah
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The order of the files listed in the directive is not significant.  The
      example above grants permission for the inclusion of the three files
      listed.  It does not require their insertion.  Note the difference
      between the two mechanisms: with the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a></code>" directive only
      "<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#include&nbsp;--&gt;</code>" is needed in the <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/MarkUp/">HTML</a> and the file inserted is taken
      (in order) from the list in the directive, while with the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.list-includes">List-Includes=</a></code>"
      directive the <a href="http://www.w3c.org/MarkUp/">HTML</a> must contain
      '<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#include&nbsp;"bah"&nbsp;--&gt;</code>' so the server
      knows to insert file "<code>bah</code>" and the file list in the
      directive is checked to see that permission to serve this file has been
      granted.  If you use the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.list-includes">List-Includes=</a></code>"
      directive you cannot also use either the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a></code>" or "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.wrappers">Wrappers=</a></code>" directives --
      the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.list-includes">List-Includes=</a></code>" and
      "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a></code>"/"<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#wrappers">Wrappers=</a></code>" mechanisms are
      mutually exclusive.  It is fine to use the line
      '<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#include&nbsp;"bar.html"&nbsp;--&gt;</code>' to
      insert a file with the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a></code>" directive, but
      with that directive the "<code>bar.html</code>" is only a comment and has
      no effect on which file is actually inserted.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#ddir.default-list-includes">Default-List-Includes=</a></code>"
      directory directive which can be used to grant permission for any <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/MarkUp/">HTML</a> file in the directory to
      include one or more of the listed files.  This also causes all <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/MarkUp/">HTML</a> files in the directory to
      acquire the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.attributes.parse">Attributes=parse</a></code>".
    </p>

    <p>
      If a file has a <a href="filter.html">filter</a> only that file will be
      filtered, not any <a href="#wrapping">wrappers</a> or includes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of a file it is possible to include the output of a program.  To
      do this the program is listed in the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a></code>" directive but
      its name is preceded with the '<code>!</code>' character. For example:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.file">File=</a>foo.html
        <br>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a>!/usr/bin/date,bar.html
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      will insert the time and date at the first
      "<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#include&nbsp;--&gt;</code>" and the contents of
      <code>bar.html</code> at the second.  "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a></code>" and "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.list-includes">List-includes=</a></code>"
      should not list arguments to programs.  Thus if you wished to use the
      output of the UNIX <code><a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man1/date.1.gz">date</a></code>
      utility to get UTC instead of local time you should create a program
      named "<code>mydate</code>" containing, for example:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        #!/bin/sh
        <br>
        exec /usr/bin/date -u
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      and use the directive "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a>!mydate</code>".
    </p>

    <p>
      This ability to serve the output of programs can be restricted in several
      ways.  If <em>WN</em> is invoked with the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#e_opt"><code>-e</code></a> option then no includes,
      <a href="filter.html">filters</a>, or <a href="cgi.html">CGI
      programs</a> will be executed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="appendixA1.html#E_opt"><code>-E</code></a> option in
      conjunction with the <a href="appendixA1.html#t_opt"><code>-t</code></a>
      or <a href="appendixA1.html#T_opt"><code>-T</code></a> options restricts
      the execution of programs to those listed in <code>index.cache</code>
      files owned by trusted users or groups.  The <a
      href="appendixA1.html#u_opt"><code>-u</code></a> option allows the
      execution of programs or inclusion of files owned by the owner of the
      <code>index.cache</code> file which lists them.  If the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#E_opt"><code>-E</code></a> and <a
      href="appendixA1.html#u_opt"><code>-u</code></a> options are used
      together the <a href="appendixA1.html#E_opt"><code>-E</code></a> option
      takes precedence.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you wish to have all the standard <a
      href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> environment variables
      made available to the executed include program you can do so by adding
      the line:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.attributes.cgi">Attributes=cgi</a>
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      to the file record.  A list of these environment variables can be found
      in the appendix "<a href="appendixD.html">CGI and other Environment
      Variables for the <em>WN</em> Server</a>" in this guide.  Also see the <a
      href="examples/sample.cgi">sample CGI program</a> which is located in the
      file /docs/examples/sample.cgi which accompanies the <em>WN</em>
      distribution.
    </p>



    <h3>6.3 <a name="if">Conditional Text: If, Else, and Endif</a></h3>

    <p>
      Often a server maintainer may wish to serve different versions of a
      document to different clients.  Here is a simple example of how this can
      be handled with <em>WN</em>.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;!--&nbsp;#if accept =~ "image/jpeg" --&gt;
        <br>
        <br>
        &lt;a href="picture.jpg"&gt;
        <br>
        Here is the jpeg version of the picture:
        <br>
        &lt;/a&gt;
        <br>
        <br>
        &lt;!-- #else --&gt;
        <br>
        <br>
        &lt;a href="picture.png"&gt;
        <br>
        Here is the png version of the picture:
        <br>
        &lt;/a&gt;
        <br>
        <br>
        &lt;!-- #endif --&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This tells the server to look at the Accept: headers provided by the
      client and if "<code>image/jpeg</code>" is among them then use the
      <code>jpeg</code> image and otherwise use the <code>png</code> image.
      More precisely, the "<code>image/jpeg</code>" part of the
      "<code>if</code>" line is a UNIX <code><a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man1/grep.1.gz">grep(1)</a></code>
      utility like regular expression and if there is any match for it among
      the <code>Accept</code> headers the <code>jpeg</code> image will be used.
      Of course these "<code>if - else - endif</code>" constructs can be
      nested.  A similar construct allows you to make the text served depend on
      matching a regular expression with the contents of the
      <code>User-Agent</code> header, the <code>Referer</code> header, the
      <code>Cookie</code> header, the client hostname, or the client IP
      address.  A complete list of possible test clauses for the
      <code>#if</code> statement is contained in appendix "<a
      href="appendixC.html">Parsed Document Syntax for the <em>WN</em>
      Server</a>" in this guide.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>Note:</em> For this to work the file containing the conditional text
      needs to be parsed by the server.  The server only knows to do this if
      the file record in the <code><a
      href="index_desc.html#index">index.wn</a></code> file contains a line
      "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.attributes.parse">Attributes=parse</a></code>".
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      If, in an "if clause", instead of the equal-tilde string
      '<code>=~</code>' (to indicate a regular expression match) the character
      string '<code>!~</code>' is used then the truth value of the match is
      reversed.  For example the lines:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;!-- #if referer !~ "my.host.edu" --&gt;
        <br>
        Here is some text for newcomers to my site.
        <br>
        &lt;!-- #endif --&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      would display the "<code>Here is some text ...</code>" to those clients
      accessing this document via any link which is not on the host
      <code>my.host.edu</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is also a <a href="appendixC.html#redirect">redirect command</a>
      which can conditionally cause the server to send an <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/Protocols/">HTTP/1.1</a> redirect to a new URL.
      For example if the text:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;!-- #if hostname =~ "\.uk$" --&gt;
        <br>
        &lt;!-- #redirect = "UK_mirror_url" --&gt;
        <br>
        &lt;!-- #endif --&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      is included at the beginning of an <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/MarkUp/">HTML</a> document then any request from
      a UK host will automatically be redirected to the specified URL, the
      <code>UK_mirror_url</code> in this case.  This mechanism could also be
      used to redirect text only browsers to a text only alternative page, etc.
      There must be no text sent before the
      '<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#redirect&nbsp;=&nbsp;"url"&nbsp;--&gt;</code>' is
      encountered (not even blank lines) since the server cannot send an <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/Protocols/">HTTP/1.1</a> redirect while in the
      middle of transmitting a document.
    </p>

    <p>
      Normally the URL in the
      '<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#redirect&nbsp;=&nbsp;"URL"&nbsp;--&gt;</code>' line
      is fully qualified, like "<code>http://host/path/foo</code>".  However,
      it can also be simply "<code>foo</code>" referring to a file in the same
      directory as the file being parsed.  In this case an <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/Protocols/">HTTP/1.1</a> redirection is not
      sent, and instead the file "<code>foo</code>" is returned immediately to
      the client.
    </p>

    <p>
      Often a single regular expression is not adequate to distinguish whether
      or not to serve some text.  For that reason <em>WN</em> allows you to use
      a file containing any number of regular expressions and serve a document
      based on whether any of these expressions match accept headers, referer
      header, user-agent, hostname, etc.  For example, if the file
      "<code>acceptfile</code>" contains the lines:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        image/png
        <br>
        image/jpeg
        <br>
        image/x-xbitmap
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      then the following conditional text might be appropriate:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;!-- #if accept file = "acceptfile" --&gt;
        <br>
        <br>
        I see you aren't using a text only browser...
        <br>
        &lt;!-- #endif --&gt;<br>
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The format of the file "<code>acceptfile</code>" is one UNIX <code><a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man1/grep.1.gz">grep(1)</a></code>
      utility like regular expression per line.  Lines beginning with
      '<code>#</code>' are taken to be comments.  If a regular expression is
      preceded by the character '<code>!</code>' then that character is skipped
      but the truth value of the match is reversed.  More information about
      files of regular expressions for conditional text can be found in
      appendix "<a href="appendixC.html">Parsed Document Syntax for the
      <em>WN</em> Server</a>" in this guide.
    </p>


    <h3>6.4 <a name="conditional">Conditional Text and Access Control
    Files</a></h3>

    <p>
      Another method of using conditional text is with a normal <em>WN</em>
      access control file.  For example:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;!-- #if accessfile="secret/access" --&gt;
        <br>
        <br>
        Here is a link to a restricted directory.
        <br>
        <br>
        &lt;a href="/secret/stuff.html"&gt;Restricted Local Stuff&lt;/a&gt;
        <br>
        <br>
        Hosts not listed in the file "secret/access" can't look at it, so why
        show them a link to it?
        <br>
        <br>
        &lt;!-- #endif --&gt;<br>
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      will display the included text and the link to
      "<code>Restricted&nbsp;Local&nbsp;Stuff</code>" only to clients on hosts
      permitted by the <a href="access.html">access control file</a>
      "<code>secret/access</code>".
    </p>



    <h3>6.5 <a name="logic">Logical Operations in If Conditions</a></h3>

    <p>
      The condition in the "<code>if</code>" or "<code>elif</code>" tags can be
      made more complex than those described above by combining simple
      conditions using the logical operations '<code>&amp;&amp;</code>' for
      'and', '<code>||</code>' for 'or' and '<code>!</code>' for 'not'.
      Parentheses may be used for grouping.  For example:
    </p>


    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;!--&nbsp;#if&nbsp;hostname&nbsp;=~&nbsp;"\.uk$"&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;accessfile="secret/access"&nbsp;--&gt;
        <br>
        <br>
        Something for those sites in accessfile but not in the UK.
        <br>
        <br>
        &lt;!-- #endif --&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This is described in greater detail in the section "<a
      href="appendixC.html#match">Matching Regular Expressions:
      <code>#if</code> and <code>#elif</code></a>" in this guide.
    </p>


    <h3>6.6 <a name="section">More on Including: the <code>section</code>
    Marker</a></h3>

    <p>
      Often you may want to include <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/MarkUp/">HTML</a> files in a larger document.
      For example, a single logical <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/MarkUp/">HTML</a> document often consists of a
      number of separate files.  This can make it very difficult for a client
      to download and print the entire document.  To alleviate this problem you
      could form a single document concatenating all the pieces, but that can
      be problematic when the document is altered or updated as it is necessary
      to change both the piece and the concatenation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>WN</em> offers a solution to this by allowing you to write a small
      skeleton document which includes all the pieces, forming a "virtual"
      document which is the concatenation.  But if we just used the mechanism
      above the concatenation document would include the
      <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> elements of all the pieces.  To remedy this you
      use the marker:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;!-- #section --&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      instead of "<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#include&nbsp;--&gt;</code>" and the
      server will include only the portion of the <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/MarkUp/">HTML</a> document between the special
      comments "<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#start&nbsp;--&gt;</code>" and
      "<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#end&nbsp;--&gt;</code>" inserted in that document.
      This requires that these starting and ending comments occur in the <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/MarkUp/">HTML</a> document on lines by
      themselves.
    </p>



    <h3>6.7 <a name="wrapping">Wrapping Files</a></h3>

    <p>
      Suppose you have a large number of files and want a standard header or
      footer placed on all of them (perhaps a standard disclaimer).  You could,
      of course, make many copies of the standard header with a different
      "<code><a href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a></code>"
      directive for each, but this is cumbersome.  It has other drawbacks as
      well, such as the fact that <a href="search.html#grep">grep</a> and <a
      href="search.html#context">context</a> searches do not search associated
      include files, only the main file.
    </p>

    <p>
      To deal with this case <em>WN</em> uses <em>wrappers</em>.  Wrapping a
      file is the inverse of including it.  If you have an <code><a
      href="index_desc.html#index">index.wn</a></code> file entry like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.file">File=</a>foo.html
        <br>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.wrappers">Wrappers=</a>bar.html
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      then the server will send the file <code>bar.html</code> looking for the
      marker "<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#include&nbsp;--&gt;</code>" and inserting
      <code>foo.html</code> at the line where it is found.  So this is just
      like the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a></code>" directive
      except the role of which file is included in the other is reversed.  If
      the include marker is never found the entire wrapper,
      <code>bar.html</code>, is sent first and the main file,
      <code>foo.html</code>, is appended at the end.  Thus the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.wrappers">Wrappers=</a></code>" directive can
      be used to prepend a file without the need of any marker in the main
      file.
    </p>



    <h3>6.8 <a name="searchwrapper">Search Wrappers</a></h3>

    <p>
      A search wrapper is a special kind of wrapper.  Its function is to allow
      you to customize the results of user searches.  It is normally associated
      with an entire directory in which case it applies to all <a
      href="search.html#title">title</a>, <a
      href="search.html#keyword">keyword</a>, <a
      href="search.html#fielded">field</a>, <a href="search.html#grep">grep</a>
      and <a href="search.html#context">context</a> searches of that directory.
      See the chapter "<a href="search.html">Setting Up Searches on the
      <em>WN</em> Server</a>" in this guide.
    </p>

    <p>
      A line like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a href="appendixB.html#ddir.searchwrapper">SearchWrapper=</a>foo.html
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      in the directory record of an <code><a
      href="index_desc.html#index">index.wn</a></code> file will cause any search
      of that directory to return an unordered list of matches wrapped with the
      file <code>foo.html</code>.  The list of matches will be inserted into
      <code>foo.html</code> at a point where the marker
      "<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#include&nbsp;--&gt;</code>" is found.  You can also
      insert the user supplied search term by using the marker
      "<code>&lt;!--&nbsp;#query&nbsp;--&gt;</code>".  Both of these markers
      must occur on a line by themselves.
    </p>



    <h3>6.9 <a name="nested">Nested Including and Wrapping</a></h3>

    <p>
      Wrapping and including can be arbitrarily nested (though this is not true
      of <a href="#searchwrapper">search wrappers</a>).  It can be a little
      complicated to get the effect you want.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is how to do it.  Think of all your files, wrappers, includes and
      the main file arranged as you wish them to be combined for the final
      served document.  Now imagine inserting an opening (or left) parenthesis
      at the beginning of each file and insert a closing (or right) parenthesis
      at the end of each file.  You should have a legally nested and balanced
      collection of parentheses.  To each of the opening parentheses attach the
      name of the file which begins at that point.  Then write down the list of
      all the file names in the order their corresponding opening parentheses
      occur.  All the files which come before the main file should be wrappers
      and should be listed in the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.wrappers">Wrappers=</a></code>" line in the
      order in which they occur in this list.  All the files after the main
      file should be in the "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a></code>" line and should
      occur in the order they occur in this list.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's a simple example.  Suppose we have a main file <code>M</code> and
      other files <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, and
      <code>D</code> which we want to have nested like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        (D...(B...B)...(M...(A...(C...C)...A)...M)...D)
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Then the entry in the <code><a
      href="index_desc.html#index">index.wn</a></code> file should look like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.file">File=</a>M
        <br>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.wrappers">Wrappers=</a>D,B
        <br>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a>A,C
      </code>
    </blockquote>



    <h3>6.10 <a name="title">Including Title, Query, Fields and Environment
    Variables</a></h3>

    <p>
      Often it is useful to insert items like the main document's title into a
      wrapper, or the search item provided by the client into a searchwrapper
      for the responses.  This is possible with <em>WN</em> parsed documents
      using the lines:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;!-- #title --&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      or:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;!-- #query --&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      in the file at the point where the title or search term should be
      inserted. Both of these markers must occur on a line by themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to the title and query <a href="field.html">user supplied
      fields</a> can be inserted in documents.  This is done by including a
      marker such as:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;!--&nbsp;#field3&nbsp;--&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      in the file at the point where the value should be inserted.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also insert the value of any environment variable into your text
      with a line like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        &lt;!--&nbsp;#environ = "HTTP_REFERER" --&gt;
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      which will be replaced by the contents of the environment variable
      <code>HTTP_REFERER</code>.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>Note:</em> If there is no "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.wrappers">Wrappers=</a></code>" or "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.includes">Includes=</a></code>" line in the
      <code><a href="index_desc.html#index">index.wn</a></code> file for this
      entry then there must be a line like:
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        <a href="appendixB.html#fdir.attributes.parse">Attributes=parse</a>
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      so the server knows it is to parse the file to look for the marker.  See
      the section "<a href="appendixB.html#fdir.attributes">Set File
      Attributes</a>" in this guide for more details.  Also if you wish to
      insert the value of a <a
      href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> environment variable
      (as in the example above) you must have an "<code><a
      href="appendixB.html#fdir.attributes.parse">Attributes=parse</a></code>"
      line.
    </p>


    <h3>6.11 <a name="metainfo">Meta Information</a></h3>

    <p>
      Strictly speaking this feature has nothing to do with parsed
      documents, but it fits here as well as anywhere.  If a URL has
      the parameter <code>meta</code> appended (with a semi-colon
      separator), as in
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        http://host/path/foo;meta
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      for example, then it will return meta data about the resource
      rather than the resource itself.  
      <a href="parse.html;meta">Here is the meta data</a> returned
      by this document when the <code>meta</code> parameter is used.
    </p>
