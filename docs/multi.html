    <h2 align="center">Multi-homed or Virtual Servers on the <em>WN</em>
    Server</h2>
    <hr size="4">

    <p>
      Many systems allow multiple IP addresses for a single host.  For systems
      with this capability it is possible to use a different data hierarchy for
      each IP address to which your host responds.  Sometimes this is referred
      to as "virtual hosts" or a "multi-homed" server since when combined with
      <a href="http://www.dns.net/dnsrd/">DNS</a> aliasing it permits a single
      server to appear to be multiple servers on different
      hosts. Unfortunately, I cannot help you in configuring your system to
      respond to multiple IP addresses.  (Some information about this can be
      found at <a
      href="http://www.thesphere.com/%7Edlp/TwoServers/">http://www.thesphere.com/%7Edlp/TwoServers/</a>)
      However, if your system supports this capability you can have different
      data hierarchies for each IP address if you run the stand-alone version
      of the server (<code>wnsd</code>).
    </p>



    <h3>12.1 <a name="one_server_one_host">One Server per Virtual Host</a></h3>

    <p>
      There are two ways to have multiple virtual hosts.  Assuming
      that you actually have more than one network interface
      (i.e. more than one NIC), the easiest is to run multiple
      instances of the server each with a different IP address indicated
      on the command line via the <a
      href="appendixA1.html#i_opt"><code>-i</code></a> option.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example running the commands:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        wnsd -i 192.168.1.1 -L abc.log /abc/root
        <br>
        wnsd -i 192.168.1.2 -L def.log /def/root
      </code>
    </blockquote>


    <p>
      will start two instances of the server, both on the same port (80) but
      responding to different IP addresses.
    </p>

    <p>
    Alternatively,
    <blockquote>
      <code>
        wnsd -h www.abc.com -L abc.log /abc/root
        <br>
        wnsd -h www.def.com -L def.log /def/root
      </code>
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
      will start two instances of the server, both on the same port (80) but
      responding to different IP addresses.  The server will ascertain the
      appropriate IP address by using the UNIX <code><a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man3/gethostbyname.3.gz">gethostbyname(3)</a></code>
      system call for the name supplied on the command line.
    </p>


    <blockquote>
      <em>Note:</em> To use this method make sure the "<code><a
      href="configmacros.html#USE_VIRTUAL_HOSTS">#define&nbsp;USE_VIRTUAL_HOSTS</a></code>"
      line in <a href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> is
      commented out.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This method has the disadvantage of using somewhat more resources than
      the alternate method (described below) because at least one instance of
      the server for each host name is running at all times and thus using
      memory.  On the other hand with this method it is possible to specify a
      different log file for each host, while the method below uses only one
      log file and a utility to separate it into the contributions of each
      host.
    </p>



    <h3>12.2 <a name="one_server_many_hosts">A Single Server with Multiple Virtual
    Hosts</a></h3>

    <p>
      The second method to implement a multi-homed server involves only a
      single initial instance of the server which responds to all requests and
      changes the document root as appropriate based on the IP address or host
      name to which the request was sent.  To use this method you need to edit
      the <a href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> file and
      uncomment the line containing "<code><a
      href="configmacros.html#USE_VIRTUAL_HOSTS">#define&nbsp;USE_VIRTUAL_HOSTS</a></code>".
    </p>

    <p>
      Then you have two choices.  You can either create a file containing a
      list of the virtual hosts or you can build this list into the compiled
      version of the sever by editing one of the source files and recompiling.
      If you have only a few virtual hosts and you don't anticipate adding new
      ones, I recommend compiling in the list.  This is easy to do and much
      more efficient if you use <code>wnd</code> with the UNIX <code><a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man8/inetd.8.gz">inetd(8)</a></code>
      system utility.  If you use <code>wnsd</code> there is little difference
      in efficiency.
    </p>



    <h4>12.2.1 <a name="one_server_many_hosts.file">Using a Virtual Hosts List
    File</a></h4>

    <p>
      You can either compile in the list of virtual hosts or keep this list
      in a file which will be read each time the server starts.  The second
      option is described here and the first is described in the next section.
      To use a virtual host file you must uncomment the line containing "<code><a
      href="configmacros.html#VIRTUAL_HOSTS_FILE">#define&nbsp;VIRTUAL_HOSTS_FILE</a></code>"
      in the file <a href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a> and
      change the quoted path to the full path of a file containing virtual host
      information in a format described below.  Then you must recompile the
      server.  Once this has been done you may change the file you use with the
      <a href="appendixA1.html#V_opt"><code>-V</code></a> option to the server.
      But to turn this feature on, it is necessary that "<code><a
      href="configmacros.html#VIRTUAL_HOSTS_FILE">#define&nbsp;VIRTUAL_HOSTS_FILE</a></code>"
      be uncommented when the server is compiled.  Each time this file is
      changed, in order for the change to take effect, you will need to restart
      the server or send it the <code>SIGHUP</code> signal with the UNIX
      <code><a
      href="/cgi-bin/man2html/usr/man/man1/kill.1.gz">kill(1)</a></code>
      utility.
    </p>

    <p>
      The format of this file is one line per virtual host.  Each such line
      should have the form:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        hostname    IP_address    root_path    vhost_nickname    user    group    flag
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      with the four parts separated by white space.  For example entries might
      be:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>
        myhost.com    111.222.222.111    /usr/wn/myroot    myhost    bob    mygroup    0<br>
        client.com    111.222.222.111    /usr/wn/client    client    george    clientgroup    1
      </code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In particular the hostname should be a fully qualified domain name.
      The <code>user</code> and <code>group</code> fields are the name of the user and
      group to be passed to <code>suexec</code> if it is used.  If it is not these
      can be set to the string <code>NULL</code>.  However, if <code>suexec</code>
      is used, both the user and group <em>must</em> be defined for each virtual
      host -- they could have the value of the user and group under which your
      server runs.  The <code>flag</code> field currently
      has only two allowable values, 0 and 1.  The value 1 indicates that
      <a href="tilde.html#home_directories">user home directories</a> are not permitted
      for this virtual host.
      Lines in this file which are empty or start with '<code>#</code>' are
      ignored.  When using verbose logging the nickname will be enclosed in
      angle brackets and used as the last field of each log entry.  If the
      nickname is omitted a number will be used representing the position of
      virtual host in the virtual host file.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default there is a maximum of 64 virtual hosts allowed in a virtual
      host file.  But this can be increased by editing the file
      <code>wn/vhost.c</code> and changing the line
      "<code>#define&nbsp;MAXVHOSTS&nbsp;(64)</code>".  Just replace the
      <code>64</code> with the value you wish.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>WN</em> supports the "<code>Host:&nbsp;</code>" header implemented by
      some browsers (e.g. <a
      href="http://www.netscape.com/download/prodinfonfs_1.html">Netscape
      Communicator</a>) and so-called "full URL requests".  For browsers that
      support either of these features it is now possible to have multiple
      virtual hosts with a single IP address.  The <a
      href="http://www.w3c.org/Protocols/">HTTP/1.1</a> protocol requires
      browsers to support the "<code>Host:&nbsp;</code>" header.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using this feature requires nothing beyond setting up the server exactly
      as described above for virtual hosts.  Of course, all your virtual hosts
      will have the same IP number if your system only has one.  Then if a
      browser provides the "<code>Host: </code>" header (which should contain
      the hostname and port it is trying to access) the <em>WN</em> server will
      use the root data directory you specified for that host name.  Similarly
      if a full URL request like
      "<code>GET&nbsp;http://host.abc.com/dir/foo.html</code>" is used the
      server will use the root data directory corresponding to
      "<code>host.abc.com</code>".  If the browser provides neither of these
      the server will use the first root data directory whose IP number matches
      (which will be the first in your list if you have only one IP address).
    </p>


    <h4>12.2.2 <a name="one_server_many_hosts.compiled">Compiling in the List
    of Virtual Hosts</a></h4>

    <p>
      To compile in the list of virtual hosts you need to edit the file
      <code>wn/vhost.h</code>.  This file is quite short and contains something
      like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
#ifdef USE_VIRTUAL_HOSTS
WN_CONST
char *
WN_CONST
vhostlist[][7] =
{
    { "realname.com" , "123.123.121.1", ROOT_DIR, "nickname0", "usr0", "grp0", "0" },
    { "virtual1.com" , "123.123.121.1", "/var/data1", "nickname1", NULL, NULL, NULL },
    { "virtual2.com" , "123.123.121.1", "/var/data2", "nickname2", "usr2", "grp2", "1" },
    { "another.ip.com", "123.123.123.2", "/var/data3", "nickname3", "usr3", "grp3", "1" },
    { NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL }
};
#endif
      </pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The line containing
      <code>{&nbsp;"virtual2.com",&nbsp;"123.123.121.1",&nbsp;"/var/data2",&nbsp;"nickname1"&nbsp;}</code>,
      etc., should be replaced by a line containing one of the IP addresses of your
      host instead of <code>"123.123.121.1"</code>, the correct system path to
      the corresponding data root instead of <code>"/var/data1"</code>, one of
      the hostnames that corresponds to this IP address, and a nickname to use
      in logging.  The <code>"usr2"</code> and <code>"grp2"</code> are only used with
      <code>suexec</code> and can have the value <code>NULL</code> if you 
      are not using <code>suexec</code>.  The final entry in this line is a string
      representing a flag for use with virtual hosting.
      For the moment it should only be <code>NULL</code> or one of the quoted strings
      <code>"0"</code> or  <code>"1"</code>.  The quoted string <code>"1"</code> disallows
      the use of any <a href="tilde.html#home_directories">user home directories</a> for
      URL's referring to this virtual host.  The values <code>NULL</code> or <code>"0"</code> are
      equivalent and give the default behavior which allows serving from user home directories
      only if the server was compiled with this feature enabled.  

      The hostname in these lines is used by the server in only two
      ways: when a redirect header is sent, and to pass the correct server host
      name to <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI/1.1</a> programs
      in the environment variable.  The nicknames are used as a field of a <a
      href="setup.html#logging">verbose log</a> entry.  When using verbose
      logging the nickname (enclosed in angle brackets) will be the last field
      of each log entry.  If the nickname is <code>NULL</code>
      then a number will be used for its value
      representing the position of virtual host in the virtual host file.
    </p>

    <p>
      All the lines of this file should be changed in a similar fashion.  You
      may have more as many lines as you wish and you should remove any of the
      lines you don't need.  Don't change anything else.  In particular make
      sure that the
      <code>{&nbsp;NULL,&nbsp;NULL,&nbsp;NULL,&nbsp;NULL,&nbsp;NULL,&nbsp;NULL,&nbsp;NULL&nbsp;}</code>
      line is unchanged and that you change only the parts inside quotation marks.  If
      the IP address by which the server is accessed does not match any of the
      addresses listed in this file then the server will use the default data
      root (as specified when you ran the <a
      href="setup.html#installing.configure"><code>configure</code></a> program
      or edited the value of "<code><a
      href="configmacros.html#ROOT_DIR">#define&nbsp;ROOT_DIR</a></code>" in <a
      href="configmacros.html"><code>config.h</code></a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      The server will not produce separate log files for each IP address.
      However, if the server is configured to produce verbose logs then each
      entry is tagged at the end with the nickname of the virtual host which
      received the request.  The <a
      href="utility.html#wnv2c"><code>wnv2c</code></a> utility can then be used
      to produce separate log files for each IP address.
